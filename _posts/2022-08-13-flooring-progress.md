It's all out of order, but I'm taking the progress. The contractor started installing the new flooring in a fuller way yesterday.

They've finished enough of the flooring to let me move everything out of my bedroom this weekend so they can then do the bedroom on Monday. Annoying as that is, I'll have a more or less finished bedroom again next week, which will be a very nice change.

The floor is being installed floating. I'm not totally sure why, though it's also somewhere I don't have strong opinions. I am worried that there are some joints that could be tighter, and that the new floor squeaks in a couple of places. Less because I really mind those little issues per se, and more in case it betrays a deeper flaw. But I have no idea what I'm doing. This could be normal.

Replacing all the flooring also means replacing the skirting board along the perimeter. This covers the expansion gap left around the flooring material to allow for expansion and contraction. The existing stuff was a pretty uninspiring stick-on vinyl. I haven't gotten into what will replace it yet.

There's still a ton to do. The fire protection firm hasn't been especially responsive. Next week I'm hoping they'll get the various cabinets installed, and they should be able to close and plaster some of the walls that aren't affected by the fire sprinkler.
