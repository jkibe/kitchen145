The new crew was back again and continues to make progress towards completion. Today, they got the vent hood (mostly) installed and started the work to finish the installation of the panels in the new entry area.

Unfortunately, in order to get the panels to work out, they needed to remove some of the Corian. There was a piece installed under the cabinets that wasn't in the same plane as another piece, and then a second vertical piece that wasn't going to cover the exposed edge of the perforated panel.

On the plus side, the newly installed (and in some cases, replaced) panels look a lot better. They replaced one of the pieces above the shelves so the pattern works, and another couple pieces on the other wall that didn't line up either. There are still a few more pieces that should get installed tomorrow.

Continuing on the millwork theme, they did some additional detailing around the oven. The handle got installed on the drawer, and a small filler piece was cut to cover the gap between the top of said drawer and the bottom of the oven. It's a small detail, and yet makes a big difference.

Last but definitely not least, the vent hood got mostly installed. They still need to add some ducting to connect it completely. I'm excited that I can do a stir fry again without needing to worry about destroying the upper cabinet boxes.

There's still a bit of detailing left to do, notably the rest of the panel install, and the long-delayed mirror that goes on the long side of the flying wall.
