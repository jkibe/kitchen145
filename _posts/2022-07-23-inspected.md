There's not too much to say for the last few weeks. But there was a bit of progress: earlier in the week the electrical inspector paid the site a visit, and passed the work. The project is still behind schedule, but this is encouraging progress to say the least.

From a budget perspective, there were a few interesting twists. The plumbing work to move the sink and add laundry wound up being more expensive than the original scope of the project suggested. The plumber hadn't anticipated needing to replace quite as much of the drain and vent stack from what I'm told.

On the plus side, through some accounting I don't totally understand, the very expensive extra plumbing work got offset with savings elsewhere, so only wound up costing about $1,000 more net.

Looking ahead, passing the rough inspections is a big step because it makes closing the walls (i.e., putting up the wallboard) possible. It goes without saying, that's an important step in making progress.
