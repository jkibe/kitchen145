Progress continues working toward completion of the first fix plumbing and electric. The plumber was on site several days running the new drain, water, and vent lines for the relocated kitchen sink. From what I can tell, everything is ready to go.

It's kind of fun to see the parts of the old drain and vent stack that the plumber cut out to tie the new lines in. They're very substantial chunks of pipe. Slightly more terrifying to peer into the old sections of pipe and see the accretion of sludge or corrosion or whatever builds up inside drain lines.

My building is about to spend $1.5 million replacing all the exterior balcony railings and floors. Perhaps the drain lines only need a good clean. I do slightly wonder how much it will cost and how complicated it will be if the drains actually need to be replaced.

My inner software developer brain wonders why the building doesn't require anyone who opens the wall to replace that section of drain and vent completely, or even subsidize that. Compared to the complication of opening and then reassembling the wall of everyone's apartments in the future, the expense and minor complication of replacing the whole section seems negligible. Perhaps another casualty of the American delusion we can all be completely self-sufficient. Or our procedure fetish.

In any case, I'm still waiting for the electrical question to be resolved, keeping my fingers crossed that they'll let me get away with not having to run a new feeder wire. From what I understand, getting the electrical work done is the next big step.
