Finally, the cabinets are ordered. But the pandemic strikes again: the final delivery window is 14 to 18 weeks. I'm hoping it will be possible to get the work started sooner. There's a lot of demolition and construction that needs to happen before the cabinets go in. Then again, from what I hear, it may also be difficult to book a contractor.

In terms of the cabinet order itself, once it was ready to go, the process was pretty painless. The total bill came to $11,509. That doesn't include all the cabinet boxes: the laundry, refrigerator, and upper cabinet boxes will be custom. But it does include additional paneling for the new entry-office area that will be created in the current kitchen.

In the next week or two I really will go look at flooring, and start figuring out how to get all my appliances here on time.
