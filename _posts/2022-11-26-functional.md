With an almighty push, I was able to get a working kitchen by Thanksgiving. All the major appliances are working, and I've got a working kitchen sink again. That's a huge relief. But there's also a lot left to do, and I'm not quite ready to call in the movers to bring back my furniture.

The electricians were on site and got a lot done. They finally connected up all the circuits and installed most of my appliances. I now have working switched lights in my living room again, a working cooktop and oven, a mostly working refrigerator, and circuits for everything from my vent hood to garbage disposal.

The plumbers got all the final plumbing work done by my reckoning. There wasn't all that much to do, though it was pretty critical. The water to my kitchen has been turned back on, and my kitchen sink has both a working faucet and drain plus garbage disposal.

They also made the plumbing connections for my new dishwasher. Of course, my insistence on having a disguised dishwasher means that it isn't completely functional. While it has power and water, the carpenter hasn't been back to install the cabinet panel --- essential for making the door easy to open --- and it's not installed into the adjoining cabinets, since that needs to be very precise, to ensure the door lines up with the other cabinets.

But: I can cook, clean, and store food now, so I can cook.

It's definitely going to get some getting used to. The fan assist in my new oven is so much more effective than my old one, I'm having to adjust my baking times.

Looking ahead, there's one big project left to do: get the cabinet panels in the old kitchen installed. There's also a bevy of smaller items that do need to be done for the project to be completely wrapped up. That's everything form installing the cabinet door handles to making sure my refrigerator is actually installed correctly into the cabinet box.
