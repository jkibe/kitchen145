After over a month of stasis, the project is creeping back to life. The fire sprinkler company finally made it today and did the work to move the sprinkler per the building inspector's demands.

This was a trickier part of the build than some others. Unlike the rest of the work, the fire sprinkler was my responsibility and not something in the contractor's purview. So I had to do all the coordination on this myself, with help from the architectural practice I'm working with.

And it's good they were around to support. If not for some help, they would have routed the sprinkler in a very strange path that wouldn't have looked too great. As it is, I'm fine living with the sprinkler head peeping out over the top of the upper cabinets.

On the plus side, the fire sprinkler contractors said that I didn't need to keep a sprinkler head in the new entry area, so that's one less ugly bit sticking out of the wall. It should make the finish a lot neater.

From here, the contractor should be unblocked. I have no idea what the timeline or order of events is, but I'm hoping they get a move on.
