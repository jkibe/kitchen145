As it turned out, the project didn't need to stop for the fire sprinkler. All that matters is having a sprinkler that meets requirements. Practically, that means some walls need to remain open in case the sprinkler does need to be adjusted.

Some isn't all, though, so they were able to make some progress today.

More specifically, they've started closing the walls on the kitchen side of the new partition. If I'm reading the materials correctly, they've used blue board rather than normal drywall. It's made of the same stuff, but has a special outside surface designed to take veneer plaster.

I'm guessing this is meant to help match with the existing walls, which are all plaster from the 1950s before gypsum wallboard became the standard.

The fire protection company is coming on Wednesday to give closure (or at least what comes next) on the fire sprinkler situation. That should let the crew close the rest of the walls.

In the meantime, this should allow for the installation of the cabinets now that the kitchen side is closed up.
