The building inspector gave clearance on closing the two remaining walls. It's a tantalizing taste of progress. On the other hand, there are still a few remaining hiccups.

Because the last two walls will get the fun CNC milled panels installed, they've gotten covered with sheets of plywood rather than plasterboard. It's an interesting look. I could see it working as a final finish if a bit more care was taken with the pattern of plywood sheets.

I had a near miss with the plumbing, though. When the plumber came to do his work initially, he added shutoff valves to my plumbing, presumably to make it easier to do the plumbing work without needing to shut down the water for all my neighbors. That hadn't been turned back on before the walls were closed. Fortunately I caught it before the panels had gone up.

Meanwhile, there are a few issues to work out on the appliance install that's precluding the countertop fabrication and installation.

I'm hopeful that we're actually getting to the end.
