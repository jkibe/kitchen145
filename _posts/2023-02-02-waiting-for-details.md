It's been a while, and to be honest, there hasn't been that much happening. There are a few small details where they've made progress. But for the most part, I'm still waiting for the last details to happen.

In terms of progress, they got more of the finish electrical done: the outlets in my former kitchen are now wired up and working. Likewise, they took care of some small details on the cabinets, such as attaching the remaining doors to the cabinet boxes.

But there are also a lot of details that remain stubbornly unfinished. None of the cabinets have pulls, so I have to open them with "handles" improvised out of the famous blue tape. Because of this, my dishwasher still doesn't have its cabinet panel, which makes it a pain to use since I have to hold the door open with my foot. I'm also missing the rest of the kitchen outlets --- there is an issue with the size of the Plugmold strip --- and the vent hood that goes above my cooktop.

The finish carpenter made some pretty serious errors installing the matched perforated panels in the new entry area as well. They've had to make replacements, and we're bringing in a different crew to finish up that and a few other details.

It's a bit less clear when that will happen, but I'm hoping that's really the last step. It's a bit wild that this project now spans four calendar years: I started working on the specifications in mid-2020, and here we are in 2023 still working on it.
