I'm very close to signing a contract to get the program going. The last detail: pinning down the cost of the electrical work. In particular, the core upgrades necessary for the increased load that the renovation will put on the system.

<!--more-->

I went into the project knowing that I'd need to upgrade the panel. For starters, I'm adding enough new circuits I need a new panel simply for space.

Current code requires more loads go on separate circuits for safety. More importantly, I'm adding a bunch of new appliances: a separate oven and cooktop (rather than the existing all-in-one range), each of which need a double-gang slot to carry 240 V to those appliances; and then a washer and dryer. Fortunately, the Miele heat pump dryer that I've specified only requires a 15 amp circuit, but each laundry appliance does need to go on its own separate circuit.

The relatively straightforward panel replacement had already been factored into the bid. But there was an additional twist that needed additional following up.

All these new appliances also require more overall capacity on the panel. My current service to the apartment is only 60 amps, common when my building was built in the 1950s, but well below current standards.

According to the electrician, the existing feeder wire --- the wire that runs from the electric meter to my apartment --- can only safely carry 75 amps. That's enough to support all the new electrical load I'm putting on the system, but below the 100 amp minimum that code currently requires for a dwelling of any size.

The question then is whether it will be possible to have my system grandfathered in. If it can be, that's a huge savings: there's no additional work to do. If it can't, then the electrician will need to run a new feeder wire from my apartment to the meter. I haven't seen pricing, but there's no way that's going to be inexpensive. The meter is about 100 feet down the common corridor from my apartment, and the new wire won't run in a completely straight line. Moreover, it will have to run through a conduit buried in a cast concrete slab.

If it has to happen, I don't have much choice but to pay for it. I also don't envy the person who has to do the work.
