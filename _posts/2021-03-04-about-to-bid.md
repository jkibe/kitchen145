More developments are afoot! The cabinet order is in, as mentioned last time. Next up, I'm making some final decisions about small details, like where to put outlets and light switches. I've also got to pick out the flooring that will replace the suspect plastic wood simulacrum that came with the apartment. With construction documents nearly done, it's also time to send the bid out to potential contractors.

The preliminary construction documents are very reassuring. Mostly in that they're so detailed. I feel even better about having paid serious professionals to work up a detailed plan. It's a easier to imagine the very expensive construction phase going well with less left to figure out in the moment.

I still need to do a bit more thinking. First, I need to confirm switch placement. Based on the plans, I don't think I'll have much to say. Rather cleverly --- though apparently this is not unusual --- the switch for the garbage disposal will be placed under the sink inside the cabinet rather than disrupt the harmony of the wall behind. I'm hoping it will be possible to add in a few more outlets here and there. They're not the most attractive part of a space, but you can never have enough.

Second, I need to pick out the flooring. This has turned into a bit of an ordeal. Before I spend $5,000 on it, I figured it would be nice to see more than a little 4 by 4 inch sample. So I took a day off to go visit some flooring showrooms at the local design center. These fancy suppliers cater mostly to professionals, and so the showrooms are only open on weekdays during business hours.

This was one option suggested to me, the thought being another white European oak would go well with the cabinets also made of that material." %}

I should've done more confirming before cycling over there to look around. I did manage to see one of the two flooring showrooms. Unfortunately, it was not the one that had my architects' first pick. The other showroom was closed because, as it turned out, the person who runs the Boston one was out sick.

In any case, the preliminary construction drawings should make it possible to begin getting bids from contractors and thus start setting dates for when the actual work begins. I'm hoping the next post will have more to say about that. Or I'll finally get the last of the flooring samples and have a final decision on that.
