The flooring continues. One more trip, and I think they'll be done with it. It's still a bit strange they're doing this now, but I'm taking the progress.

They've now finished laying the new flooring everywhere save for the old kitchen. This is pretty transformative. It would be nicer if I had a working kitchen (the original point of the project), but it's incredibly nice not to have to walk around in dirt all the time.

According to the flooring team, the unevenness of the new floor and the fact it makes some noises in place is normal, and the byproduct of the floor being floating. I kind of wonder what would've happened if they'd used a leveling product, but I think that ship has sailed. It looks great and feels so much better than the weird plastic flooring that I had before.

They did have to apply floor leveler to the former kitchen area, though. That has to cure before than can cover it, so the flooring team will be back at least one more time.

The fire sprinkler firm got back to me: about $2000 to remedy the sprinkler situation. Worse still, it sounds like the permit to do the work will take many weeks. By chance, the walls that need to remain open for the sprinkler fixes don't need any plaster or paint, so it may not be quite as big a deal as I'd feared.

What comes next, I'm not totally sure. I think some additional millwork will make it to site tomorrow, and of course they need to finish the flooring.
