It's been an interesting few weeks. I spent over two of them elsewhere, mostly because I was afraid that as they got going on the more involved electrical and plumbing work, I might not have power or water. In the end, that didn't happen, but it was still nice to escape the construction site and take a few days off.

While I was gone, a the project did make some progress. They removed asbestos, did more wiring, and (today) got going on the plumbing.

As part of the asbestos removal, they tore down what remained of the old kitchen wall, and then added new framing where that had been. From what I could tell, that was a relatively straightforward process.

More involved (and still unresolved) was the electrical work. The most straightforward reading of the electrical code meant that I was initially required to upgrade my 60 A service --- a relic from the 1950s --- with 100 A service, the modern minimum. That requires upgrading the conductors that run from my apartment to the electric meter, no mean feat when that new feeder line had to run through a 70-year-old conduit buried in cast concrete.

Despite several attempts, the electricians were unable to run the new feeder. The current plan is to go back to the city electrical department and argue that the actual load fits within the limits of 60 A service. It's not a huge apartment after all. Whether that will land remains to be seen. I'm hoping it will.

From what I understand, the alternative would be incredibly expensive and disruptive: destroying the common hallway to run a new feeder through the ceiling there.

In the meantime, more (successful) electrical wiring happened. Several new circuits were run, and they began the process of upgrading my panel.

Regulations dominated aesthetic considerations in one case. They had to add an outlet for the small run of counter space to the left of the new sink. The electrical code requires any run of counter space over 12" to have at least one outlet.

More interestingly, they were able to wire for the LED strips using very narrow 18 gauge conductors, as (presumably) the LEDs are so low power.

Work on the first fix plumbing also got started. There's not a ton to see yet, only the beginnings of new drain and vent lines.

Progress, for sure. I'm less sure they're going to make it to the early July deadline.
