The painters have been back and continue to make progress. I made one small mistake that hopefully isn't too hard to remediate. Most dramatically, they've gotten the plywood ready for the millwork installation.

My error was one of omission. A few years ago I repainted most of my apartment myself over a few weekends. After much debate, I used Farrow and Ball "Strong White," which I thought struck a nice balance between coolness and intensity. (My initial idea to use their "All White" was very instructive. The intensity of that nearly seared my retinas.)

Rather than have the painters start from scratch, I figured it would be easiest to repaint in the same color. But I failed to mention that I wanted Farrow and Ball's flat finish paint, rather than eggshell. I'm hoping they need to come back for a second coat after sanding, and can correct this without too much of a problem.

The repairs to wall and ceiling damage continues as well. It's looking good. While they still have more work to do, it's a lot better than it was. In a few places, aside from the fact it hasn't been painted yet, all the construction scars are completely gone now.

In anticipation of the millwork installation next week, the plywood panels have gotten their coat of black paint. It's made the old kitchen space a lot more dramatic. Fortunately it won't be quite as dark once the millwork goes in on top. Though I do kind of like the look.

Next week I'm hoping they can finish the painting, get the millwork installed, and, if they can get the countertops installed too, the project may actually get wrapped up. Or at the very least, I may have a working kitchen again.
