Progress in the week after the big push has been slower. The countertop team did make a fourth and I hope final appearance. As far as I can tell, they're truly done. It looks good, and it's very gratifying.

The waterfall piece on the side of the oven cabinet was the last major component to go in. It was a bit tricky, requiring them to sand off a finished edge and seam the side piece to the main body of the countertop. The end result looks pretty good.

There were a few other small parts to finish up too. They buffed out a few nicks the electricians left behind and did some sealing to prevent water from getting to vulnerable wood surfaces.

The project is tantalizingly close to done. It's almost more painful the closer it gets to being finished. The biggest project still to do is the installation of the wood panels in the former kitchen area. I'm really hoping that does happen this week: once that's been taken care of, I think I'm in good shape to have all my furniture moved back from storage. I'll finally have my home back, even if there are still a few assorted punch list items left to do.
