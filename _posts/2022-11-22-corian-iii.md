With Thanksgiving fast approaching, I've been really pushing to get the project to the point that I could at least cook dinner Thursday. The solid surface installers were on site again Monday to continue progress on the Corian.

On Friday they wrapped up most of the backsplash pieces. On Monday, they continued with a return piece to cover the side of the wall opening, as well as (almost) all the pieces to clad the upper cabinet boxes. It's an interesting sight to see the pieces compressed into place temporarily while the adhesive cures. They weigh a ton, so it's not surprising they need some initial support.

They still have a few more pieces to do. There's a tiny piece that needs to go in on the underside of the cabinets, and another piece that goes on the side of the oven cabinet to cover that cabinet box and complete the look.

Today, there's supposed to be quite a bit of activity. The plumber and electrician should be on site to install appliances and the plumbing fixtures. The carpenter is supposed to be back to get the rest of the millwork installed.
