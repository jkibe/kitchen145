The painters made another trip and wrapped up their work. It's nice to be another step closer to having my home back.

If the vast quantity of home renovation media teaches us anything, it's that an image or video conceals many sins when it comes to painting. Which is to say, I found it difficult to convey the sense of progress the painting has given when you're on the site in person. It feels a lot more finished.

Most visibly, all the ceiling scars have been patched, sanded, and painted. I'm trying not to get too hung up on the details: it looks a lot better now. Without knowing where the old walls came down, I doubt anyone could point to where the patches have been done. The fresh coat of paint on the ceiling makes a surprisingly big difference, as I may have noted earlier.

The crew also patched a hole in the bathroom wall, painted the new baseboard in my bedroom, and fixed my error with a coat of flat paint over the eggshell. It's still drying, so it doesn't have the delicious velvety feel quite yet.

I'm really hoping the contractor can keep this momentum up. Aside from the punch list, we're down to only a few major jobs. They need to install the CNC panels in the old kitchen space, which gets most of the remaining material off the floor. All the Corian needs to be installed. Once that's done, they can finish the plumbing and electric, and I think we're close to done.
