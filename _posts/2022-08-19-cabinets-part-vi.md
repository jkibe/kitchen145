At long last, the cabinets are beginning to go in. It's not without incident, but I'm taking the progress.

There's not really much more to say than that. They've delivered the custom boxes for the upper and tall cabinets to site, and everything has been installed and screwed in.

It's a big relief both to see them installed and installed well. They're level. They're flush. And, most importantly, my precious Miele dishwasher has a 60 cm wide opening to install into. It's amazing how big a difference that 3/8" makes between 60 cm and 2 feet for the installation of that dishwasher.

There are a couple small issues that will need to be fixed later. I'm really hoping they can do something about the peeling edge banding on the upper cabinets. And the contractor mistakenly cut the bottom off the refrigerator cabinet, which had been designed to provide the appropriate venting for my built-in fridge-freezer.

It is cool to see the boxes that were fabricated custom for the project. There's something very pleasing about the cutout for the insert hood being so precise.

Among other progress, all the flooring is down now, too. This has been a pretty huge improvement in my quality of life living on site. The first bit was nice, but it's even better for everything to be done.

With the flooring down, they're also installing the skirting board to cover the gap around the floor to allow for expansion and contraction. It's so much nicer than the weird stick-on vinyl skirting that the previous owner had installed.

Looking ahead, the only thing I know for sure is that the appliances will get delivered on Wednesday. That will be really exciting. They're my one true splurge on this project.
