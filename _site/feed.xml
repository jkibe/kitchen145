                <title>Corian, Part IV</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Progress in the week after the big push has been slower. The countertop team did make a fourth and I hope final appearance. As far as I can tell, they’re truly done. It looks good, and it’s very gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waterfall piece on the side of the oven cabinet was the last major component to go in. It was a bit tricky, requiring them to sand off a finished edge and seam the side piece to the main body of the countertop. The end result looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Just About Functional</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;With an almighty push, I was able to get a working kitchen by Thanksgiving. All the major appliances are working, and I’ve got a working kitchen sink again. That’s a huge relief. But there’s also a lot left to do, and I’m not quite ready to call in the movers to bring back my furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electricians were on site and got a lot done. They finally connected up all the circuits and installed most of my appliances. I now have working switched lights in my living room again, a working cooktop and oven, a mostly working refrigerator, and circuits for everything from my vent hood to garbage disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/cooktop-installed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cooktop&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The cooktop sits flush with the countertop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plumbers got all the final plumbing work done by my reckoning. There wasn’t all that much to do, though it was pretty critical. The water to my kitchen has been turned back on, and my kitchen sink has both a working faucet and drain plus garbage disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also made the plumbing connections for my new dishwasher. Of course, my insistence on having a disguised dishwasher means that it isn’t completely functional. While it has power and water, the carpenter hasn’t been back to install the cabinet panel — essential for making the door easy to open — and it’s not installed into the adjoining cabinets, since that needs to be very precise, to ensure the door lines up with the other cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But: I can cook, clean, and store food now, so I can cook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s definitely going to get some getting used to. The fan assist in my new oven is so much more effective than my old one, I’m having to adjust my baking times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, there’s one big project left to do: get the cabinet panels in the old kitchen installed. There’s also a bevy of smaller items that do need to be done for the project to be completely wrapped up. That’s everything form installing the cabinet door handles to making sure my refrigerator is actually installed correctly into the cabinet box.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Corian, Part III</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;With Thanksgiving fast approaching, I’ve been really pushing to get the project to the point that I could at least cook dinner Thursday. The solid surface installers were on site again Monday to continue progress on the Corian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday they wrapped up most of the backsplash pieces. On Monday, they continued with a return piece to cover the side of the wall opening, as well as (almost) all the pieces to clad the upper cabinet boxes. It’s an interesting sight to see the pieces compressed into place temporarily while the adhesive cures. They weigh a ton, so it’s not surprising they need some initial support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-upper-close.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Corian being supported&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Bracing has been installed to support the Corian while the adhesive cures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They still have a few more pieces to do. There’s a tiny piece that needs to go in on the underside of the cabinets, and another piece that goes on the side of the oven cabinet to cover that cabinet box and complete the look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, there’s supposed to be quite a bit of activity. The plumber and electrician should be on site to install appliances and the plumbing fixtures. The carpenter is supposed to be back to get the rest of the millwork installed.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Corian, Part II</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I take the progress I can get. The solid surface team returned yesterday to continue working on the Corian installation. They definitely moved the project forward — more on that in a bit — though didn’t quite get the installation done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course of this project never did run smooth. There was some confusion around the space that would be left underneath the cabinets for the strip of LED lighting and power outlets. Those will get hidden in a small gap between the bottom of the cabinet boxes and the backsplash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-backsplash-corner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Backsplash&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The backsplash has gone in successfully&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it was possible to swap out the half-inch wallboard with quarter-inch wallboard to compensate for the fact they’ve had to use half-inch (rather than quarter-inch) Corian on the backsplash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-channel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Channel&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A strip of LED lights and a run of outlets will get installed in this gap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that detail in place, they were able to successfully install the backsplash pieces behind the cooktop and on the side wall with the lighting controls. It looks very sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also drilled out the hole for the sink faucet. I was a bit overeager and roughly installed the faucet (which has been sitting, waiting, in my apartment for months) to see what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-faucet-temporary.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Faucet mock up&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;I couldn't help myself and slipped the faucet in to see what it would look like. Sadly, the plumbing isn't connected up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the solid surface installers weren’t quite able to finish by the time my building’s approved construction hours ran out. They’ve still got to install pieces to clad the underside of the upper cabinets, a piece on the side of the upper cabinet run, and a small piece to cover the currently exposed side of the oven cabinet at the end of the base cabinet run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Thanksgiving rapidly approaching next week, I’m really hoping they can get enough done in the working days next week that I can have a working kitchen again. Given how this effort has gone, I think truly finishing the project is probably unrealistic. But if I could have a working refrigerator, a bit of lighting, water, and my appliances working, that would be pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Countertop Installation Begins</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;With painful slowness, there has been a tiny bit of additional progress. The solid surface installers were here yesterday and made a good start getting all the Corian installed. That will make up the worktops themselves, and also clad surfaces like the backsplash and underside of the upper cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s another one of those steps that’s gratifying in that the kitchen is finally beginning to feel complete. In theory, there really are only a few more days of work to go. Seeing the sink properly in place is really encouraging: I’m hoping I could have working plumbing again very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-wide.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Counter installed&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The Corian over the base cabinets has gone in&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as seems to be the theme on this project, this step has not been without its challenges. The solid surface team had to demount the panels that started going up last Thursday in what was the kitchen. There were concerns with their installation anyway, so perhaps it’s not a huge loss. It’s hard not to feel the step backwards: something finished now looks incomplete again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also hit snags with some of the other details on the Corian install, which meant they weren’t able to get beyond the sheets over the base cabinets. There’s still a lot to do: the backsplash, waterfall pieces along the un-clad cabinet boxes, and the exposed sides of the upper cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-sag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sagging cabinet box&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;I'm not totally sure what happened here in the cabinet box that holds the sink, but it doesn't look great&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few weird details that made me raise my eyebrows as well. There’s a worrying amount of sag in the fronts of the cabinet boxes that will support the new cooktop and sink. And I’ve found a few more places where my beautiful new floor has been dinged in probably irreversible ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping they’re able to continue the momentum and get the bulk of the major steps done this week.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Panel Installation</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The project continues to inch toward the finish line. Yesterday, they began installing the wood panels in what was the kitchen area. It’s a surprisingly delicate and complicated ballet of pieces that need to line up due to the perforations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they had to install the floating steel shelves. Having lugged two of them up from the basement when they were delivered, they are astonishingly heavy. Installed, they have that fun feeling of defying gravity. I’m a little less excited about the fact they cut holes in the newly finished and painted wall to fit them in. That’s not going to be a fun patch job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/panels-opening.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Through the opening&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Looking through the kitchen wall, it's a bit easier to see the floating steel shelves&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panels themselves aren’t quite done. But they made a ton of progress, and it’s beginning to look good. Once again, I find myself in the interesting position where I take photos and it looks so like the renders that I looked at almost two years ago in the design phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/panels-detail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Panel detail&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The thick flying wall that backs the kitchen cabinets will get an end cap mirror to add light and a feeling of space&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve been told, they won’t be back until Monday to finish the panels. The other big blocker is the solid surface cladding that will form the countertops, backsplash, and caps around the upper cabinets. Once that’s in, the plumbing and electrical get get wrapped up, as the sink, faucet, and appliances all interface with those pieces in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Painting, Part III</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The painters made another trip and wrapped up their work. It’s nice to be another step closer to having my home back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the vast quantity of home renovation media teaches us anything, it’s that an image or video conceals many sins when it comes to painting. Which is to say, I found it difficult to convey the sense of progress the painting has given when you’re on the site in person. It feels a lot more finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/painting-hall-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking down the hall&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;All the marigold paint is now gone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most visibly, all the ceiling scars have been patched, sanded, and painted. I’m trying not to get too hung up on the details: it looks a lot better now. Without knowing where the old walls came down, I doubt anyone could point to where the patches have been done. The fresh coat of paint on the ceiling makes a surprisingly big difference, as I may have noted earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/ceiling-patched.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ceiling&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Virtually impossible to tell where the ceiling damage was&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crew also patched a hole in the bathroom wall, painted the new baseboard in my bedroom, and fixed my error with a coat of flat paint over the eggshell. It’s still drying, so it doesn’t have the delicious velvety feel quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really hoping the contractor can keep this momentum up. Aside from the punch list, we’re down to only a few major jobs. They need to install the CNC panels in the old kitchen space, which gets most of the remaining material off the floor. All the Corian needs to be installed. Once that’s done, they can finish the plumbing and electric, and I think we’re close to done.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Painting, Part II</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The painters have been back and continue to make progress. I made one small mistake that hopefully isn’t too hard to remediate. Most dramatically, they’ve gotten the plywood ready for the millwork installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My error was one of omission. A few years ago I repainted most of my apartment myself over a few weekends. After much debate, I used Farrow and Ball “Strong White,” which I thought struck a nice balance between coolness and intensity. (My initial idea to use their “All White” was very instructive. The intensity of that nearly seared my retinas.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than have the painters start from scratch, I figured it would be easiest to repaint in the same color. But I failed to mention that I wanted Farrow and Ball’s flat finish paint, rather than eggshell. I’m hoping they need to come back for a second coat after sanding, and can correct this without too much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repairs to wall and ceiling damage continues as well. It’s looking good. While they still have more work to do, it’s a lot better than it was. In a few places, aside from the fact it hasn’t been painted yet, all the construction scars are completely gone now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/painting-black.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plywood painted black&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The two panel walls got a coat of black paint before the panels get attached&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of the millwork installation next week, the plywood panels have gotten their coat of black paint. It’s made the old kitchen space a lot more dramatic. Fortunately it won’t be quite as dark once the millwork goes in on top. Though I do kind of like the look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I’m hoping they can finish the painting, get the millwork installed, and, if they can get the countertops installed too, the project may actually get wrapped up. Or at the very least, I may have a working kitchen again.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Painting Begins</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Progress has resumed with a few visits from the painting crew. Their work is an object lesson in the value of painting and the benefit of hiring true professionals to do the work. No, painting isn’t that difficult. But it’s clear that people who do this for a living know what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s largely preparation at this point. They’re filling holes, doing patches, caulking and otherwise getting all the surfaces ready to receive the paint. It’s weirdly satisfying to finally see the last vestiges of the previous owner’s marigold paint get covered with primer. It wasn’t my favorite color. I never painted over it because I knew — eventually — I’d do this bigger project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/painting-hall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Priming over marigold paint&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Primer goes on the last parts of my apartment still in the marigold that the previous owner had chosen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of artistry that goes into some parts of this process amazes me. Around the old kitchen walls, the ceiling looks pretty dire. Seeing the supplies and sheer quantity of filler required to patch and repair those wounds is fascinating. From what the painting crew said, it will take another day or two to finish up that work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/painting-patch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Patching the ceiling&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Initial patching work to repair the ceiling scars&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the less damaged parts of the ceiling, you can begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I never would have guessed that repainting the ceiling would make such a huge difference, and yet, it really does look a lot better. I may have to get a painting crew (or spend a weekend) doing the same in my bedroom after this project gets wrapped up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A fresh coat of flat white paint on the ceiling&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, there’s still more painting to do. The plywood that closed the two walls behind the new kitchen needs to get a coat of black paint, to disappear behind the white perforated panels. The real constraint are the countertops, which would then let the finish plumbing and electrical happen.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The building inspector gave clearance on closing the two remaining walls. It’s a tantalizing taste of progress. On the other hand, there are still a few remaining hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the last two walls will get the fun CNC milled panels installed, they’ve gotten covered with sheets of plywood rather than plasterboard. It’s an interesting look. I could see it working as a final finish if a bit more care was taken with the pattern of plywood sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a near miss with the plumbing, though. When the plumber came to do his work initially, he added shutoff valves to my plumbing, presumably to make it easier to do the plumbing work without needing to shut down the water for all my neighbors. That hadn’t been turned back on before the walls were closed. Fortunately I caught it before the panels had gone up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there are a few issues to work out on the appliance install that’s precluding the countertop fabrication and installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hopeful that we’re actually getting to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
