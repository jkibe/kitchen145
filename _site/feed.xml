                <title>New Crew, Part II</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The new crew was back again and continues to make progress towards completion. Today, they got the vent hood (mostly) installed and started the work to finish the installation of the panels in the new entry area.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>New Crew</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The new crew that we found came by for their first day of work on Friday. Finally, we’re making progress again. While they did uncover a few problems, there is also tangible improvement: no more improvised blue tape handles on the cabinet doors, and my dishwasher has its front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost: it’s amazing to have a permanent way to open all the cabinets. We chose some nice minimal black pulls to go on all the cabinet doors. If I’d had the budget, I would have liked to get a kitchen with a channel along the top of the boxes, so I could go handle-free. That was also an option with my design, but I wasn’t a fan of the push-to-open mechanism on the pull outs. When I visited a few showrooms, it always seemed a bit too finicky and unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/pull-dw-closed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dishwasher closed&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The dishwasher finally has its cabinet front&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refrigerator and freezer doors require somewhat more substantial hardware, which hasn’t arrived yet. That will go in later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also exciting: the new finish carpenter made a stab at getting my dishwasher fully installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/dishwasher-propped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dishwahser propped open&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The new dishwasher I had to buy supports Miele's knock-to-open system that's fun, though probably not strictly necessary&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the cabinet panel has been attached to the front. This had been a real frustration since without it I had to use my foot to hold the door open loading and unloading the dishes. The hinge is designed to work smoothly when there’s a heavy cabinet door on the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that it’s in, I’m back in bliss. The hinges that Miele puts on its dishwashers are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/dishwasher-open.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dishwasher open&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The dishwasher now stays open without my foot holding down the door&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit less convinced some of this new dishwasher’s other features are really that important. The interior lighting looks nice. I’m not sure it makes anything easier. The knock-to-open feature is fun. It’s also a bit of a hassle versus pulling the door open normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing the dishwasher did, however, uncover new problems. Apparently the sink cabinet was installed a few millimeters further forward than the other boxes, so there are some issues getting everything to really line up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, the new crew is definitely confidence inspiring. They’ll be back Monday to take care of a few other remaining pieces, like finally getting my vent hood installed and remediating the panels in the new entry area.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Waiting for Final Details</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while, and to be honest, there hasn’t been that much happening. There are a few small details where they’ve made progress. But for the most part, I’m still waiting for the last details to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of progress, they got more of the finish electrical done: the outlets in my former kitchen are now wired up and working. Likewise, they took care of some small details on the cabinets, such as attaching the remaining doors to the cabinet boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are also a lot of details that remain stubbornly unfinished. None of the cabinets have pulls, so I have to open them with “handles” improvised out of the famous blue tape. Because of this, my dishwasher still doesn’t have its cabinet panel, which makes it a pain to use since I have to hold the door open with my foot. I’m also missing the rest of the kitchen outlets — there is an issue with the size of the Plugmold strip — and the vent hood that goes above my cooktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/feb23-piano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Former kitchen space&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;I've moved some books and furniture into the former kitchen space that's now a sort of entry-office&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finish carpenter made some pretty serious errors installing the matched perforated panels in the new entry area as well. They’ve had to make replacements, and we’re bringing in a different crew to finish up that and a few other details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/feb23-panels.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Former kitchen space&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Replacements for the damaged and incorrectly installed cabinet panels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit less clear when that will happen, but I’m hoping that’s really the last step. It’s a bit wild that this project now spans four calendar years: I started working on the specifications in mid-2020, and here we are in 2023 still working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Inching Toward Completion</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of activity on site yesterday as the carpenters returned to make progress on millwork installation. They got most of the panels mostly installed, and they made some progress fixing other issues like the appliance installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the appliances, the oven shelf got installed, so my oven is now correctly installed above the lower drawer. Unfortunately, the power receptacle for the oven is too big. The electricians will have to come back and make some adjustments to the oven can be pushed all the way back into the cabinet box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/oven-drawer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Oven moved&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The oven is now in the correct location above the drawer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, my refrigerator installation got closer, but still isn’t quite there. They flipped the door, so it’s now hinged on the left. This makes a lot more sense trying to get out ingredients from the kitchen area on the right of it. It’s also now firmly anchored in the cabinet box. That said, I have some concerns: the top filler piece still isn’t installed correctly, and the front of the appliance isn’t plumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/panels-nearly.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Panels installed&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Ignore the mess: the panels are now mostly and mostly correctly installed, the last big messy job&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest and messiest job got close as well: the carpenter got most of the mega pegboard panels mostly installed. It looks very slick, and it will look even better once the former kitchen area gets tidied up. Of course, nothing on this project is without caveats. One of the panels was installed the wrong way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confusion more generally resulted in having to sacrifice a couple of panels. Good planning meant there’s an extra sheet they can use to re-make the missing pieces. Those will get CNC milled to the exact size required, and should slot in later without too much fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I’m finally getting all my furniture back in. Though there are still myriad additional punch list items that need to get done, however. Probably most acutely in my eyes: handles for all my cabinets and getting the cabinet panel installed on my dishwasher. It’s very difficult to load when you have to hold the door down with one arm or your leg.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Corian, Part IV</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Progress in the week after the big push has been slower. The countertop team did make a fourth and I hope final appearance. As far as I can tell, they’re truly done. It looks good, and it’s very gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waterfall piece on the side of the oven cabinet was the last major component to go in. It was a bit tricky, requiring them to sand off a finished edge and seam the side piece to the main body of the countertop. The end result looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/waterfall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Waterfall countertop&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The last major piece to install was a waterfall on the side of the oven cabinet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few other small parts to finish up too. They buffed out a few nicks the electricians left behind and did some sealing to prevent water from getting to vulnerable wood surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is tantalizingly close to done. It’s almost more painful the closer it gets to being finished. The biggest project still to do is the installation of the wood panels in the former kitchen area. I’m really hoping that does happen this week: once that’s been taken care of, I think I’m in good shape to have all my furniture moved back from storage. I’ll finally have my home back, even if there are still a few assorted punch list items left to do.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Just About Functional</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;With an almighty push, I was able to get a working kitchen by Thanksgiving. All the major appliances are working, and I’ve got a working kitchen sink again. That’s a huge relief. But there’s also a lot left to do, and I’m not quite ready to call in the movers to bring back my furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electricians were on site and got a lot done. They finally connected up all the circuits and installed most of my appliances. I now have working switched lights in my living room again, a working cooktop and oven, a mostly working refrigerator, and circuits for everything from my vent hood to garbage disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/cooktop-installed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cooktop&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The cooktop sits flush with the countertop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plumbers got all the final plumbing work done by my reckoning. There wasn’t all that much to do, though it was pretty critical. The water to my kitchen has been turned back on, and my kitchen sink has both a working faucet and drain plus garbage disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also made the plumbing connections for my new dishwasher. Of course, my insistence on having a disguised dishwasher means that it isn’t completely functional. While it has power and water, the carpenter hasn’t been back to install the cabinet panel — essential for making the door easy to open — and it’s not installed into the adjoining cabinets, since that needs to be very precise, to ensure the door lines up with the other cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But: I can cook, clean, and store food now, so I can cook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s definitely going to get some getting used to. The fan assist in my new oven is so much more effective than my old one, I’m having to adjust my baking times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, there’s one big project left to do: get the cabinet panels in the old kitchen installed. There’s also a bevy of smaller items that do need to be done for the project to be completely wrapped up. That’s everything form installing the cabinet door handles to making sure my refrigerator is actually installed correctly into the cabinet box.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Corian, Part III</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;With Thanksgiving fast approaching, I’ve been really pushing to get the project to the point that I could at least cook dinner Thursday. The solid surface installers were on site again Monday to continue progress on the Corian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday they wrapped up most of the backsplash pieces. On Monday, they continued with a return piece to cover the side of the wall opening, as well as (almost) all the pieces to clad the upper cabinet boxes. It’s an interesting sight to see the pieces compressed into place temporarily while the adhesive cures. They weigh a ton, so it’s not surprising they need some initial support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-upper-close.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Corian being supported&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Bracing has been installed to support the Corian while the adhesive cures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They still have a few more pieces to do. There’s a tiny piece that needs to go in on the underside of the cabinets, and another piece that goes on the side of the oven cabinet to cover that cabinet box and complete the look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, there’s supposed to be quite a bit of activity. The plumber and electrician should be on site to install appliances and the plumbing fixtures. The carpenter is supposed to be back to get the rest of the millwork installed.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Corian, Part II</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I take the progress I can get. The solid surface team returned yesterday to continue working on the Corian installation. They definitely moved the project forward — more on that in a bit — though didn’t quite get the installation done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course of this project never did run smooth. There was some confusion around the space that would be left underneath the cabinets for the strip of LED lighting and power outlets. Those will get hidden in a small gap between the bottom of the cabinet boxes and the backsplash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-backsplash-corner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Backsplash&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The backsplash has gone in successfully&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it was possible to swap out the half-inch wallboard with quarter-inch wallboard to compensate for the fact they’ve had to use half-inch (rather than quarter-inch) Corian on the backsplash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-channel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Channel&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A strip of LED lights and a run of outlets will get installed in this gap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that detail in place, they were able to successfully install the backsplash pieces behind the cooktop and on the side wall with the lighting controls. It looks very sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also drilled out the hole for the sink faucet. I was a bit overeager and roughly installed the faucet (which has been sitting, waiting, in my apartment for months) to see what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-faucet-temporary.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Faucet mock up&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;I couldn't help myself and slipped the faucet in to see what it would look like. Sadly, the plumbing isn't connected up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the solid surface installers weren’t quite able to finish by the time my building’s approved construction hours ran out. They’ve still got to install pieces to clad the underside of the upper cabinets, a piece on the side of the upper cabinet run, and a small piece to cover the currently exposed side of the oven cabinet at the end of the base cabinet run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Thanksgiving rapidly approaching next week, I’m really hoping they can get enough done in the working days next week that I can have a working kitchen again. Given how this effort has gone, I think truly finishing the project is probably unrealistic. But if I could have a working refrigerator, a bit of lighting, water, and my appliances working, that would be pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Countertop Installation Begins</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;With painful slowness, there has been a tiny bit of additional progress. The solid surface installers were here yesterday and made a good start getting all the Corian installed. That will make up the worktops themselves, and also clad surfaces like the backsplash and underside of the upper cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s another one of those steps that’s gratifying in that the kitchen is finally beginning to feel complete. In theory, there really are only a few more days of work to go. Seeing the sink properly in place is really encouraging: I’m hoping I could have working plumbing again very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-wide.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Counter installed&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The Corian over the base cabinets has gone in&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as seems to be the theme on this project, this step has not been without its challenges. The solid surface team had to demount the panels that started going up last Thursday in what was the kitchen. There were concerns with their installation anyway, so perhaps it’s not a huge loss. It’s hard not to feel the step backwards: something finished now looks incomplete again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also hit snags with some of the other details on the Corian install, which meant they weren’t able to get beyond the sheets over the base cabinets. There’s still a lot to do: the backsplash, waterfall pieces along the un-clad cabinet boxes, and the exposed sides of the upper cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/counters-sag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sagging cabinet box&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;I'm not totally sure what happened here in the cabinet box that holds the sink, but it doesn't look great&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few weird details that made me raise my eyebrows as well. There’s a worrying amount of sag in the fronts of the cabinet boxes that will support the new cooktop and sink. And I’ve found a few more places where my beautiful new floor has been dinged in probably irreversible ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping they’re able to continue the momentum and get the bulk of the major steps done this week.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Panel Installation</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The project continues to inch toward the finish line. Yesterday, they began installing the wood panels in what was the kitchen area. It’s a surprisingly delicate and complicated ballet of pieces that need to line up due to the perforations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they had to install the floating steel shelves. Having lugged two of them up from the basement when they were delivered, they are astonishingly heavy. Installed, they have that fun feeling of defying gravity. I’m a little less excited about the fact they cut holes in the newly finished and painted wall to fit them in. That’s not going to be a fun patch job.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Looking through the kitchen wall, it's a bit easier to see the floating steel shelves&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panels themselves aren’t quite done. But they made a ton of progress, and it’s beginning to look good. Once again, I find myself in the interesting position where I take photos and it looks so like the renders that I looked at almost two years ago in the design phase.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The thick flying wall that backs the kitchen cabinets will get an end cap mirror to add light and a feeling of space&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve been told, they won’t be back until Monday to finish the panels. The other big blocker is the solid surface cladding that will form the countertops, backsplash, and caps around the upper cabinets. Once that’s in, the plumbing and electrical get get wrapped up, as the sink, faucet, and appliances all interface with those pieces in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
