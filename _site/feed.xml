                <title>Not Quite</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the contractor was on site again, which was at least superficially exciting. As ever, I got home last night with a bit of trepidation as well. That emotion proved to be warranted. While they tried to install the appliances, they did not succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Caséta Interlude</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;As the days get shorter and the project remains uncompleted, it’s gotten more annoying that there’s no way to turn on a light when I get home without stumbling in the dark. Last week, I decided to do something about it by setting up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://casetawireless.com&quot;&gt;Lutron Caséta&lt;/a&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lutron’s Caséta system brings ideas that used to be the preserve of very expensive custom installations into the mass market. The Caséta dimmers and switches operate existing lighting circuits. They also connect to a network bridge that allows the lights to be automated in fun and interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can bridge the Caséta system into Apple’s HomeKit universe (or use Lutron’s iOS application) to control the lights and program scenes with your phone. Or you can use system accessories like Lutron’s Pico remote to drop a switch anywhere (they operate over a proprietary wireless band) to control one or multiple lighting circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s this last part that I took advantage of to deal with my “getting home and it’s pitch black” problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replaced a few of the switches in the unaffected parts of my apartment with Caséta dimmers. Then I set up a Pico remote to operate those circuits. The remote is cleverly the same size as a decorator-style switch, and Lutron provides a holder to retrofit it into a standard switch box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually there will be a switch next to my front door that controls a lighting circuit. For now, I’ve slipped in a Pico remote to turn on other lights to avoid tripping in the dark. It’s still not exactly great, but it’s much improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/caseta-entry.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Caséta Pico remote&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Pico remote temporarily installed in the entry junction box&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a system, I’m impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Caséta “universe” is incredibly reliable. Ridiculous as it sounds, this is a big deal. I’ve used the Philips Hue system before, and, nice as it is, the fact the controls fail one out of even a thousand times is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really appreciate that the system doesn’t solely rely on special controls or a piece of smartphone software. You can use the system as normal. The normal switches in the normal place work as normal. Normal people can operate the lights without special instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/caseta-dimmer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Caséta dimmer&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A circa 1950 switch replaced with a new Lutron Caséta dimmer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only major downside is the system’s cost. Each of the switches runs about $60, and the cost doesn’t go down if you instead use a simple on-off switch rather than a dimmer. Plus the cost of the remotes (maddeningly, $20 for the white ones and $40 for the black ones) and the network bridge (about $100).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I’ve had to use dimmers on all my old lighting circuits because the simple on-off switches require a neutral wire. That wasn’t how they ran lighting circuits in the 1950s. If I’m honest, having dimmers everywhere is kind of nice and kind of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more “this would be nice” level, there are two small paper cut issues I’d love to have them address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I really wish it were possible to change the way the lights turn on and off. I’m sure most people think the subtle fade up and fade down make the system feel more “premium.” There are places it feels weird. Like in the bathroom. It’s nice to have the ability to dim the lights. I’d really rather than simply (or more quickly) turn on and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it would be nice if Lutron were more open to other systems. The Pico remote is a genius concept. I’d love to be able to control devices outside Lutron’s switches or their universe of hand-selected partners.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Sprinkler Move</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;After over a month of stasis, the project is creeping back to life. The fire sprinkler company finally made it today and did the work to move the sprinkler per the building inspector’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a trickier part of the build than some others. Unlike the rest of the work, the fire sprinkler was my responsibility and not something in the contractor’s purview. So I had to do all the coordination on this myself, with help from the architectural practice I’m working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s good they were around to support. If not for some help, they would have routed the sprinkler in a very strange path that wouldn’t have looked too great. As it is, I’m fine living with the sprinkler head peeping out over the top of the upper cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/sprinkler-moved.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Relocated fire sprinkler&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Relocated to cover the new cooktop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, the fire sprinkler contractors said that I didn’t need to keep a sprinkler head in the new entry area, so that’s one less ugly bit sticking out of the wall. It should make the finish a lot neater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, the contractor should be unblocked. I have no idea what the timeline or order of events is, but I’m hoping they get a move on.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Delivery</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Progress continues to inch along. The builders were back doing some electrical work and continuing to work on the cabinets. Tantalizingly, after a slight hiccup last week I finally got my appliances delivered. A step toward completion, even if I can’t use them yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electricians were back on site to start preparing for the second fix. Most of the wiring is now in place for the final boxes and connections to be made at the panel. I’m less clear why they punched a couple of holes in the that had been plastered. They’re not exactly attractive. I’m hoping they get covered up later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/mystery-holes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Holes in the wall&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;It's not totally clear why they cut these two holes into the plastered back wall&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work also continued on the cabinets. They were re-aligned so that the fridge-freezer will be in-plane with the rest of the base cabinets. Holes were cut into the tops for the eventual installation of the cooktop and sink. They left the sink in the cutout, which is fun to see. It’s obviously not plumbed in, but there’s something about it that helps me feel the progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also finally got my appliances delivered. I think they’re a ways off installing them, but it’s great to see them on site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The appliances in their boxes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, I’m not entirely sure what’s next. Here’s hoping they can get the bulk of it done by the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Ups and Downs</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;As seems to be the pattern, there has been some encouraging progress this week, but with some asterisks. They installed most of the cabinet fronts and started the plaster. It’s starting to really look finished. A few of the details are giving the progress a bit of a sour note, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, there was a lot of progress. The drawers and base cabinet fronts are in. Those Blum drawer runners are truly a joy and feel worth every penny. Drawers on base cabinets are the way to go. If you don’t look too hard, it all looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/cabinet-doors-overall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets with doors&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;From  a distance, it looks pretty reasonable&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In person, though, I find the installation at this stage a bit disappointing. I knew that I wouldn’t get the millimeter-precise alignment of cabinets from someone like SieMatic by going this more budget-friendly route, but I still feel like the alignment of the doors could be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/cabinet-flaw-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cabinet door&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;It certainly looks to me like they drilled through the face of the cabinet and patched it&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More worrying to me, there are clear installation defects that, at least to my eyes, go beyond usual issues. To my eyes, it really looks like the face of one of the doors got drilled through and patched. It’s not a great look. The fact that the hinges also don’t sit cleanly and flush in the back of the doors, and that there was clearly tear out when they drilled out the hinge cups, gives me pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I wind up having to replace the damaged doors, I don’t want to think about the lead time on those parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/cabinet-flaw-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Back of a cabinet door&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;More worrying details on the back of the cabinet doors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plastering got started, too. Aside from the inevitable mess, I’m pretty happy with the way it looks. It’s beginning to make the space feel more finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/plaster-back.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plaster going in&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The first coat of plaster going in on the back wall&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I’m still waiting on the fire sprinkler permit and, after a false start, the appliances should get delivered next week.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Cabinets, Part VI</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;At long last, the cabinets are beginning to go in. It’s not without incident, but I’m taking the progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not really much more to say than that. They’ve delivered the custom boxes for the upper and tall cabinets to site, and everything has been installed and screwed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a big relief both to see them installed and installed well. They’re level. They’re flush. And, most importantly, my precious Miele dishwasher has a 60 cm wide opening to install into. It’s amazing how big a difference that 3/8” makes between 60 cm and 2 feet for the installation of that dishwasher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple small issues that will need to be fixed later. I’m really hoping they can do something about the peeling edge banding on the upper cabinets. And the contractor mistakenly cut the bottom off the refrigerator cabinet, which had been designed to provide the appropriate venting for my built-in fridge-freezer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is cool to see the boxes that were fabricated custom for the project. There’s something very pleasing about the cutout for the insert hood being so precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/cabinet-hood-cutout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hood cutout&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;An opening cut into one of the upper cabinets for the insert hood&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other progress, all the flooring is down now, too. This has been a pretty huge improvement in my quality of life living on site. The first bit was nice, but it’s even better for everything to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flooring in the entry&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Buried beneath the materials, the last of the flooring went down in the newly created entry area&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the flooring down, they’re also installing the skirting board to cover the gap around the floor to allow for expansion and contraction. It’s so much nicer than the weird stick-on vinyl skirting that the previous owner had installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/baseboard-install.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Baseboard installation&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;With the flooring done, the skirting or baseboard can be installed&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the only thing I know for sure is that the appliances will get delivered on Wednesday. That will be really exciting. They’re my one true splurge on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Flooring, Part II</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The flooring continues. One more trip, and I think they’ll be done with it. It’s still a bit strange they’re doing this now, but I’m taking the progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve now finished laying the new flooring everywhere save for the old kitchen. This is pretty transformative. It would be nicer if I had a working kitchen (the original point of the project), but it’s incredibly nice not to have to walk around in dirt all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-bedroom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flooring&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;My bedroom has flooring again&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the flooring team, the unevenness of the new floor and the fact it makes some noises in place is normal, and the byproduct of the floor being floating. I kind of wonder what would’ve happened if they’d used a leveling product, but I think that ship has sailed. It looks great and feels so much better than the weird plastic flooring that I had before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-level.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Floor leveling applied&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The old kitchen needed floor leveler, which has to cure before more flooring goes down&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did have to apply floor leveler to the former kitchen area, though. That has to cure before than can cover it, so the flooring team will be back at least one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire sprinkler firm got back to me: about $2000 to remedy the sprinkler situation. Worse still, it sounds like the permit to do the work will take many weeks. By chance, the walls that need to remain open for the sprinkler fixes don’t need any plaster or paint, so it may not be quite as big a deal as I’d feared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What comes next, I’m not totally sure. I think some additional millwork will make it to site tomorrow, and of course they need to finish the flooring.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Flooring Progress</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s all out of order, but I’m taking the progress. The contractor started installing the new flooring in a fuller way yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve finished enough of the flooring to let me move everything out of my bedroom this weekend so they can then do the bedroom on Monday. Annoying as that is, I’ll have a more or less finished bedroom again next week, which will be a very nice change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-low.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flooring&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;It's beginning to look finished&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The floor is being installed floating. I’m not totally sure why, though it’s also somewhere I don’t have strong opinions. I am worried that there are some joints that could be tighter, and that the new floor squeaks in a couple of places. Less because I really mind those little issues per se, and more in case it betrays a deeper flaw. But I have no idea what I’m doing. This could be normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-interface.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flooring meets the wall&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Eventually there will be new skirting&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing all the flooring also means replacing the skirting board along the perimeter. This covers the expansion gap left around the flooring material to allow for expansion and contraction. The existing stuff was a pretty uninspiring stick-on vinyl. I haven’t gotten into what will replace it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-storage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Materials&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Materials ready to go&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still a ton to do. The fire protection firm hasn’t been especially responsive. Next week I’m hoping they’ll get the various cabinets installed, and they should be able to close and plaster some of the walls that aren’t affected by the fire sprinkler.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Millwork Begins</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The bad news: it may take ages to deal with the fire sprinkler. The good news: work continues on the other side of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire protection company made a visit on Wednesday. The sprinkler head definitely needs to be replaced: at the point it has any paint on it, it’s no longer useful. It will also be necessary to run a new sprinkler head in the new kitchen wall, so that the relocated cooking area is directly covered by a sprinkler. On the plus side, it should be possible to conceal the sprinkler in the wall, so I won’t have any weird pipe running across the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’d like to hope otherwise, the person from the fire protection company suggested it could take many weeks just to get the permit to change the fire sprinkler, let alone actually do the work. All of which does not bode well from a time or cost perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The millwork on the other side of the wall has started going in, though, which is good to see. It’s weird. The cabinet boxes are both smaller and larger than I had imagined now they’re roughly in place. I’m slightly worried about the space between some of the cabinets and some circulation space. In other places, it’s not as bad as I feared it might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve also started putting down the new flooring. It’s really pleasing to see it in place, both from the perspective of seeing progress and knowing that I’ve made a choice I like for the new material. So much of this project is a leap of faith; it’s nice when the concept is just as good when executed as it is on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more of that to go. And the rest of the cabinets should go in soon as well. Those have been fabricated to custom sizes so that the limited space is maximized.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the project didn’t need to stop for the fire sprinkler. All that matters is having a sprinkler that meets requirements. Practically, that means some walls need to remain open in case the sprinkler does need to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some isn’t all, though, so they were able to make some progress today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, they’ve started closing the walls on the kitchen side of the new partition. If I’m reading the materials correctly, they’ve used blue board rather than normal drywall. It’s made of the same stuff, but has a special outside surface designed to take veneer plaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Closing on the kitchen side&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing this is meant to help match with the existing walls, which are all plaster from the 1950s before gypsum wallboard became the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire protection company is coming on Wednesday to give closure (or at least what comes next) on the fire sprinkler situation. That should let the crew close the rest of the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, this should allow for the installation of the cabinets now that the kitchen side is closed up.&lt;/p&gt;
