                <title>Cabinets, Part II</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The cabinet saga continues. It’s turning out to be a surprisingly fraught question. Perhaps that makes sense given it is the biggest single expense in the whole project. On the other hand, lots of other very expensive choices were easy, be that the layout or my prospective fancy German appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, I had gotten some preliminary estimates on cabinet prices, and all but ruled out “the Germans:” Bulthaup, Poggenpohl, Leicht, SieMatic. I was still waiting on firmer pricing from them, as well as pricing from a few more options. I’ll get into where I’m thinking in a moment. First, I want to do a bit of public service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Reform's Frame series in white (Image credit: Reform)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when I was doing this project on my own, I found it somewhat maddening that none of the really high-end cabinet companies gave even a hint of what their prices were online or even when I went to visit a showroom in a couple of cases. So I’m going to quickly list out some of the prices that my architects pulled for this project. I’m hoping that Google indexes this page, and then the next time someone types “SieMatic pricing” into Google, they might get this page and find something that’s actually informative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Manufacturer&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Details&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Poggenpohl&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Segmento series&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;At least $50,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Bulthaup&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Standard wood veneer, counters, backsplash, sink, faucet included&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$55,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;SieMatic&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Pure collection “Similaque” with laminated door edges, lighting included&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$37,200&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Leicht&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Topos wood veneer, lighting, tax, shipping, delivery included&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$37,200&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Leicht&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fenix NTM doors, lighting, tax, shipping, delivery included&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$28,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Leicht&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Laminate doors, lighting, tax, shipping, delivery included&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$25,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Space Theory&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Laminate or natural wood veneer doors&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$22,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Custom Cabinets&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Painted wood doors&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$15,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Reform&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Up with Ikea boxes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$10,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Reform&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Frame with Ikea boxes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$10,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Reform&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Degree with Ikea boxes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$7,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Reform&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Basis with Ikea boxes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$5,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve left out the option I’m probably going to choose — Reform cabinet boxes with Reform fronts — because I’m still not sure the pricing on that option is exactly right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, as these prices suggest, I’m not going to be getting my cabinets from one of the German brands. To keep to my overall $40,000 budget, the cabinets need to sit somewhere around $10,0000, and even the cheapest option from Leicht is more than twice that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that I’ve seen some samples of the Reform options (at this point only in photos, but hopefully in the flesh soon!), and they’re quite nice. In my mind, the biggest disadvantage of their system relative to the more expensive ones is flexibility: they can’t make boxes in totally custom sizes to use up every last inch of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/ikea.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Ikea cabinet displays&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Ikea's cabinet boxes on display with transparent fronts to show off the hardware. They're using white-label Blum Tandembox, which, while nice, is not as good as the Blum Legrabox system.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, the Reform first-party cabinet boxes use Blum’s top-of-the-line Legrabox drawer system, the same set of drawer runners that all the really high-end companies use. The only real sacrifice there is a few millimeters here and there: Poggenpohl uses their own drawer boxes that are 8 mm thick rather than the Blum Legrabox system at a comparatively gigantic 12 mm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/november-white.png&quot; alt=&quot;The current concept in white&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The current layout thought in white. They've added in my real appliances (at least the ones that will be visible) and some touches like the idea of adding an uplight rather than a second level of upper cabinets. (Image credit: BOS|UA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of cabinets will also guide a lot of the timing. Assuming I go with one of the Reform options, that will take about 3-4 months to manufacture and ship over from Denmark. The idea, then, is to iron out the remaining details as part of the design, find a contractor, get approvals, and then begin work so that when the cabinets arrive everything is ready for them to go in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My architects seem to think that a wood finish would look good. I’m leaning more towards something in a solid color. I don’t know that I have any sort of principled argument, other than I find a solid color more to my taste. I’m also slightly reneging on my appliance choices: after giving it some thought, I think I want a 30” cooktop after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The same as above, but in an oak veneer rather than a painted finish. (Image credit: BOS|UA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s all still up in the air. I’m hoping within the next few weeks I can have all the basic layout and cabinet choices made so this can really get going. Much as I don’t love the idea of living with dust everywhere, the road to a better kitchen will have to begin with a little bit of demolition.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Cabinets Are Expensive</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;When we left off, I had been asked to choose a layout. There was the more conservative option — leaving the kitchen in place and slightly reorganizing — versus the bolder option of creating an office with a linear kitchen in my living room. After some consideration, I decided to go down the linear kitchen route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area where the new cabinets go is already dead space: I can’t put anything there because it would block access to the rest of my apartment and the kitchen. If I can fill that in, and also get a small room for a desk or my piano, that seems like a great idea. It also made a lot more sense when I realized it was possible to get rid of the island-cum-dining table. I should probably get a smaller dining table at some point, but in any case, that’s much more flexible when it’s not fixed as a set of cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, the next choice I have to make is where to get the cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cabinet choice is perhaps the most vexed question of the whole project. I’m pretty adamant about getting nice appliances, so I’m taking as a given that I’ll spend more there than most people would. Construction is more or less a fixed cost: either the plumbing is successfully configured or it’s not. As far as I’m aware, there’s no “luxury plumbing” I could buy to go in the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/option3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kitchen Render&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The prospective reconfiguration. (Image credit: BOS|UA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If money were no object, I’d get cabinets from one of the high-end German manufacturers. But it wasn’t clear exactly how much these companies charged for their products. When I went to visit places like Poggenpohl and SieMatic in the pre-architect days, they more or less refused to give me prices without fairly detailed architectural drawings. It seemed within the realm of possibility that — especially since it’s such a small kitchen — I might be able to squeeze a fancy German kitchen into my big-but-not-really-that-big roughly $40,000 budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rough estimates that my architects got were surprising. Some were more than I would’ve imagined. Others were still outside my budget, but a lot more reasonable than I would’ve guessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most expensive were Bulthaup — at a whopping $55,000 — and Poggenpohl. Money aside, Poggenpohl was my top pick. They are so expensive that projects have a hard floor of $50,000, and it’s hard to imagine that I’d want to get the absolute cheapest, most basic option they offer. They’re so expensive the Poggenpohl team didn’t even want to see the drawings to contemplate giving a more affordable bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second choice, SieMatic, came in lower than I would’ve guessed, at around $25,000. My architects also looked at Leicht, which came in around the same price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/siematic-pure-010.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;SieMatic Pure&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A SieMatic Kitchen I can't afford. (Image credit: SieMatic)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zooming out a little, the cabinets more or less need to cost about $10,000. With my $40,000 budget, about $10,000 will go to appliances, and the architects are working with a $10,000 figure for all the construction costs, like moving the plumbing and moving walls. With $10,000 spent on cabinets, that leaves a further $10,000 for other finishes like worktops and lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus: the final option on the table is the “IKEA hack.” In particular, my architects have proposed going with Reform, a company out of Copenhagen that offers “designer” fronts for IKEA cabinet shells. That looks like it will fall somewhere closer to $7500 for the options that looked the most promising to me. I should get a quote from Space Theory in the next few days as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Reform's Degree design. (Image credit: Reform)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, I find this comforting. I worry that I’m spending way, way too much money on fancy appliances. But even if I go down to more “conventional” choices for my oven or refrigerator, I still wouldn’t be able to afford one of my fancy German cabinet options. It seems possible I might even get the project in under $40,000, which could leave some latitude for buying some extra fancy lighting or laundry appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I have this narrowed down a bit, there will be more renders to finalize the design, and then it comes down to scheduling. Finding a contractor will depend a lot on the point at which I can take delivery of the cabinets at the core of the design.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Step One</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;While signing up with an architect is a big step, I don’t think the project will feel completely real until I start signing the really big checks and the construction team starts to set up camp in my living room. Even so, it’s getting interesting. I had the first formal meeting with the architects after signing the paperwork, and we have some preliminary options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few weeks should see us achieve a few key milestones in terms of the schedule. Most importantly, I need to choose a layout, which drives most of the other decisions on the project. I’ve also been asked to start assembling a list of appliances, fixtures, and fittings so we can begin to price everything out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the appliance end of things, I have a head start. I bought a swanky Miele dishwasher — they really are the best — a couple of years ago, which will be reinstalled in the new kitchen. Given my excellent experience with Miele products over the years, I’d love to outfit the whole kitchen with their stuff. It’s slightly complicated by the fact they sell only a small, less up-to-date line of products in the US, and the models they do have here are exceptionally pricey. I’ll have to see how other parts of the budget shake out. I am very tempted to spring for the Miele cooktop anyway. It’s the only one I’ve been able to find that can bridge all the power together to send 7700 W to a single pan. It might actually be possible to do great stir fry at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/dishwashers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dishwashers&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Shopping for dishwashers in a more innocent time at Yale Appliance.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the slightly more consequential decision about the layout, the architects have proposed a couple of different layout concepts. First, the more straightforward option maintains essentially the same layout, but opens the space up and makes it a bit more sociable. On the downside, it doesn’t really create all that much more space to work in, and it would be possibly even more of a squeeze to fit multiple people in the kitchen at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, this exercise has really brought home the fact I could use more space, full stop. And while the real estate agent that helped me buy this apartment told me to start planning for “phase II” when I signed the offer letter, I don’t think that’s in the cards anytime soon. It’s slightly horrifying to think for the money I’m spending to completely redo my kitchen, I could only buy about 25 more square feet of space in this neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/conservative.png&quot; alt=&quot;Safe option&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The more conservative option: this keeps my services in more or less the same place but rearranges to make things more open and create more work space. (Image credit: BOS|UA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second more interesting option I can’t quite make my mind up on. It’s definitely bold. In this world, what’s now the kitchen becomes (at least in this version) an office. The kitchen then rather voraciously gobbles up the living room and a closet to span over 15 feet, plus a mini-island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/bold.png&quot; alt=&quot;Interesting option&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The more inventive option: in this world, the kitchen spreads its wings. I get a big long linear run of cabinets at the cost of a closet, and a mini extra room for something where the kitchen sits now. (Image credit: BOS|UA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the extra space for cooking, of course. I’m less sure I want the kitchen to take over quite so much, however well the ultimate design manages to blur the kitchen into the background and turn it into furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve wondered whether the putative office couldn’t become something other than an office. While working in my bedroom is maybe not ideal, I’ve settled into a nice rhythm. Whereas, if it could be made to feel less closed off, it might be fun to turn the former kitchen into a “music room”, so that the living space doesn’t feel quite as cramped if the kitchen gets so moved around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubtless, there will be some further revisions. I’m not sure how often I’ll update this as those move along, but at the very least there will be another post in a few weeks when the layout and some other final decisions are made. It’s becoming real! As long as the budget doesn’t completely fall apart — and perhaps skirting over the whole my-home-will-be-a-construction-site issue — this should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Finding an Architect</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve crossed the Rubicon. On Friday, I signed the paperwork to engage an architectural practice and get the project underway. I’ll have more to share about what I’m doing later once the actual design and build processes get underway. For now, I’ll walk through the mechanics of even finding an architect to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, I’ve wanted to hire an architect. But it wasn’t entirely clear whether my project was big enough to justify hiring one. Obviously if you’re building a house, you’ll need an architect. If the project is really small — replacing a bathroom vanity or installing built-in bookcases — you probably don’t need an architect. Others advised me that an architect would add to the project cost, and that a good design-build contractor could deal with my changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I found a credible contractor, though, it became clear I needed an architect in at least some capacity. Their stated reason had something to do with regulations governing fire suppression systems. There’s a fire sprinkler in my kitchen, and it’s possible it may need to be moved. That, apparently, requires a registered architect to sign off on the plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between my ambivalence about the contractor to begin with and the supposed requirement, when I decided to dust this project off around a month ago I decided I would at least explore the idea of hiring an architect. If they told me my project was too small, at least I’d know that I had made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding an architect, though, proved to be harder than I would’ve guessed. Most of the obvious resources like Houzz were unhelpful in that the sort order of firms tended to correlate with the size or “prestige” of the practice, and there weren’t a lot of other levers to find what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s being in New England or being in the US more generally, most firms seem to cater to people who want something either very cookie cutter or very showy. There are lots of photos of double-wide Wolf ranges that cost more than some compact cars and other touches that look generically expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/pictures/kitchens/kitchen-krieger-associates-architects-inc-img~ad81ab970f7c97cc_9-4138-1-8234192.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;No thanks kitchen image&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A cookie-cutter high-end suburban kitchen. At least this one looks well-executed, even if the design is a little tired. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.houzz.fr/photos/kitchen-phvw-vp~771539&quot;&gt;Photo&lt;/a&gt; courtesy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.houzz.fr/hznb/professionnels/architecte/krieger-associates-architects-inc-pfvwus-pf~1702898409&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Krieger + Associates Architects, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are places like Architizer or even Instagram. But the listing sites don’t tend to be comprehensive — the practice I hired isn’t on Architizer, for example — and Instagram is hard to browse if you’re looking for more than “inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I found a firm through a combination of meticulousness and good luck. The initial shortlist of firms came from literally clicking on close to 100 firms’ listings on Houzz and though more straightforward Web searches. From there, a few never wrote back to my emails, and a few set up initial consultations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what I would’ve guessed, a lot of firms have such a backlog of work that at least a few couldn’t have fit me in until the next year. Fortunately, the director of one practice was able to refer me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bos-ua.com/about/&quot;&gt;BOS|UA&lt;/a&gt;, who (most importantly) really impressed me, and had enough capacity to start my small project immediately to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every practice I talked to made me feel pretty confident that hiring an architect was the right choice. Even the fanciest-looking practices that listed very big, very expensive projects on their websites seemed very down to earth and willing to take on my project. They all, even in my brief consultations, had ideas that never would have crossed my mind. The architects at the practice I wound up hiring suggested, for instance, that there were a few ways I might avoid moving my electrical panel. Avoiding that one change alone probably covers the cost of hiring them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I have since discovered that architects’ fees typically run about 10-15% of the construction cost. In other words, for a $50,000 project, the architects’ fees would run round $5,000 to $7,500. Some will literally charge a fraction of the construction bill. Others — including all the firms that made my shortlist, which was not intentional but probably not a coincidence — bill either hourly or with fixed fees. As one person put it to me, there really isn’t a lot more work involved for the architects if I happen to want a really expensive refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial consultation, the architects sent over a formal proposal. Basically, a contract about the work, including a rough schedule, pricing, and each side’s obligations. Signing that document on Friday is what kicked off this whole process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All-in, I’ll be spending about $4500 in architects’ fees, which works out to something like 15% of my (very provisional) $30,000 construction budget. There’s some variability in the cost of the construction administration phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fee structure breaks down roughly equally through the different major design phases. The first chunk to establish the current site conditions, the second to build a rough schematic design, the third to develop more detailed drawings for regulatory approval, and fourth the final detailed drawings and final budget tweaks. That comes to about $4,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, I’ve chosen to spend the extra money — billed hourly — to have the architects manage the team of contractors actually doing the construction. On the surface it seems like a slightly absurd level of bureaucracy for such a small project: I manage the architects who manage the general contractor who manages the actual workers. But even my brief interactions with general contractors have convinced me this will probably be worth the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have more to say on the project design in a few weeks. They’re working away: my first design meeting happens at the end of the month. For now, I’ve been asked to put together a mood board (the headline image) to give the architects an idea of what I want. I’m also beginning to think about cash flow, the true limits of what I’m going to spend, and how I’m going to cope for a few months without a kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I have a chance, I may share some preliminary thoughts about those questions. For now, stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Where We've Been</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the details of what’s happening with the kitchen project now, I thought it would be a good idea to take a step back and explore how I got here. It’s been a long journey from deciding to take on this project to realizing it’s harder than I thought, and then having plans derailed by a once-in-a-lifetime public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was shopping for a place to buy, it quickly became clear that the kitchens fell into one of two camps. Either they hadn’t been touched for 30 years, or they were recently renovated, but with questionable taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/shopping.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Questionable kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;One option I didn’t go for. The cabinet installers were so bad, I can tell some of the doors aren’t in alignment by looking at this photo, which is hiding many smaller sins. This apartment also had the disadvantage of being in a basement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One apartment I looked at (sadly, I forgot to take a photo) had a kitchen that was more or less a corner of the living room in which they’d installed a $10,000 Sub-Zero refrigerator and a half-size dishwasher. Yes, I could have removed it after purchase, but then I’d have had to pay for a $10,000 refrigerator that I didn’t want. Others, like the one in the photo above, were clearly designed to tick boxes on a real estate listing, not work well as a system. One easy check: nothing I looked at had a dishwasher that cost more than my most expensive stock pot. Admittedly, my most expensive stock pot cost about $400 — which is a lot for a piece of cookware — but it’s also really not that much for a dishwasher. By comparison, that expanse of low-grade jet black granite probably cost upwards of $5,000. It truly boggles my mind someone would want such fancy worktops but skimp on way more useful choices, like spending the extra money to get drawers with nice runners instead of shelves in the lower cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/shopping2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Questionable kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another option I didn’t take. The second “bedroom” was more of a closet. Note that they did upgrade to (ugly) beige granite worktops to tick the “granite counter” box on real estate listings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I chose to go for something that hadn’t been touched for 30 years. How hard could it be to scape together $20,000 to renovate a kitchen? As it turns out, pretty hard when you vastly underestimate all the leeches who siphon money off unsuspecting people when you buy a home and encounter some novel personal financial issues. (I’m not allowed to discuss those for legal reasons.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/current.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse into my current tiny kitchen, taken the day I moved in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I had the money put together last fall, I also realized that $20,000 wasn’t going to be enough for my tiny kitchen and big ambitions. At the moment, I’m budgeting closer to $30,000, and I wouldn’t be surprised if I spend more like $40,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/sketch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current layout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this was a small project, the idea of hiring an architect seemed like an indulgence at first. I felt good enough planning something out with basic CAD software to hand off to what I hoped would be a competent contractor who might be capable of helping me iron out some of the more ambiguous details. My choices were fairly modest: Ikea cabinets to save money, locating services like plumbing to avoid expensive changes to the structure. Even that, however, proved to be too much. Every contractor I spoke to said I’d need an architect, if only to comply build local building regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/sketch2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The renovation concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, the process of finding a contractor isn’t one known for being pleasant. My experience didn’t do much to counter that. No one seems to have realized it’s easy to set up an email address, let alone a website. Hunting them down was a game of telephone tag. Call at off hours, and they’ve checked out for the day. Call during the day, and they barely give you notice because they’re trying to finish their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I did find someone, it was not an especially productive relationship. Despite being a man, I’m pretty sure I fell victim to “mansplaining.” Because my kitchen was built in the 1950s, they decided to put the electrical panel in the kitchen. Rotating the layout virtually necessitates moving that, which is expensive, probably in the region of $3000. It’s a strange feeling to put that in an email and mention it on the phone up front, only to have the someone call and spend 20 minutes explaining it again, as if there was no way I could have understood it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, the pandemic hit. With it came a construction ban in my building and the necessity that I work from home more or less indefinitely. The idea of living off microwave meals and takeout isn’t super appealing to me. But at least in the pre-covid world I would have been able to commandeer friends’ kitchens, eat out at restaurants, and travel freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the realization that the public health crisis may last for another year or more that pushed me to bring this project back to life. If I wait for the situation to really improve, it might be 2022 before I have a new kitchen — five years after I moved in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time, I’ll share my experiences finding an architect to whip the project into shape. I figure, if I have to engage a firm anyway, I might as well have them help me build something that goes beyond my amateur efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Resurrection</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost three years since I bought my apartment with the idea of renovating the kitchen, and I still haven’t done anything beyond install a new dishwasher. The first hurdle was getting the money together. Even my tiny kitchen with modest upgrades is going to be fairy expensive. Then, of course, the world was hit with a pandemic. Stuck at home and without the ability to really travel or visit friends, I didn’t love the idea of living on a construction site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I realized we could be in this situation for a very long time, however. It’s time to take the leap and begin the renovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve set up this new blog to keep a running diary of the process. I’m hoping to keep interested people informed with a difference. Yes, I’ll have the usual photos and commentary of the process as it goes along. But I’m also going to be very honest about details that a lot of people seem to skim over. Living on a construction site isn’t fun, and major home renovations are not cheap. It’s misleading to imagine that you can achieve Architectural Digest-quality with pluck and elbow grease. I’ll spend more on my architects than you’d pay for a high-end watch or fancy handbag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that by chronicling all the little details most people omit, this will be a more interesting and a more useful guide for anyone else hoping to take on a project like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my next post, I’ll piece together more of a project update recapping where I am today, and what’s happening as I dust off the project and get it moving again. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
