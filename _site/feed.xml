                <title>Ups and Downs</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;As seems to be the pattern, there has been some encouraging progress this weak, but with some asterisks. They installed most of the cabinet fronts and started the plaster. It’s starting to really look finished. A few of the details are giving the progress a bit of a sour note, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Cabinets, Part VI</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;At long last, the cabinets are beginning to go in. It’s not without incident, but I’m taking the progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not really much more to say than that. They’ve delivered the custom boxes for the upper and tall cabinets to site, and everything has been installed and screwed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a big relief both to see them installed and installed well. They’re level. They’re flush. And, most importantly, my precious Miele dishwasher has a 60 cm wide opening to install into. It’s amazing how big a difference that 3/8” makes between 60 cm and 2 feet for the installation of that dishwasher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple small issues that will need to be fixed later. I’m really hoping they can do something about the peeling edge banding on the upper cabinets. And the contractor mistakenly cut the bottom off the refrigerator cabinet, which had been designed to provide the appropriate venting for my built-in fridge-freezer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is cool to see the boxes that were fabricated custom for the project. There’s something very pleasing about the cutout for the insert hood being so precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/cabinet-hood-cutout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hood cutout&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;An opening cut into one of the upper cabinets for the insert hood&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other progress, all the flooring is down now, too. This has been a pretty huge improvement in my quality of life living on site. The first bit was nice, but it’s even better for everything to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flooring in the entry&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Buried beneath the materials, the last of the flooring went down in the newly created entry area&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the flooring down, they’re also installing the skirting board to cover the gap around the floor to allow for expansion and contraction. It’s so much nicer than the weird stick-on vinyl skirting that the previous owner had installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/baseboard-install.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Baseboard installation&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;With the flooring done, the skirting or baseboard can be installed&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the only thing I know for sure is that the appliances will get delivered on Wednesday. That will be really exciting. They’re my one true splurge on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Flooring, Part II</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The flooring continues. One more trip, and I think they’ll be done with it. It’s still a bit strange they’re doing this now, but I’m taking the progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve now finished laying the new flooring everywhere save for the old kitchen. This is pretty transformative. It would be nicer if I had a working kitchen (the original point of the project), but it’s incredibly nice not to have to walk around in dirt all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-bedroom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flooring&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;My bedroom has flooring again&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the flooring team, the unevenness of the new floor and the fact it makes some noises in place is normal, and the byproduct of the floor being floating. I kind of wonder what would’ve happened if they’d used a leveling product, but I think that ship has sailed. It looks great and feels so much better than the weird plastic flooring that I had before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-level.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Floor leveling applied&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The old kitchen needed floor leveler, which has to cure before more flooring goes down&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did have to apply floor leveler to the former kitchen area, though. That has to cure before than can cover it, so the flooring team will be back at least one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire sprinkler firm got back to me: about $2000 to remedy the sprinkler situation. Worse still, it sounds like the permit to do the work will take many weeks. By chance, the walls that need to remain open for the sprinkler fixes don’t need any plaster or paint, so it may not be quite as big a deal as I’d feared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What comes next, I’m not totally sure. I think some additional millwork will make it to site tomorrow, and of course they need to finish the flooring.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Flooring Progress</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s all out of order, but I’m taking the progress. The contractor started installing the new flooring in a fuller way yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve finished enough of the flooring to let me move everything out of my bedroom this weekend so they can then do the bedroom on Monday. Annoying as that is, I’ll have a more or less finished bedroom again next week, which will be a very nice change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-low.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flooring&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;It's beginning to look finished&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The floor is being installed floating. I’m not totally sure why, though it’s also somewhere I don’t have strong opinions. I am worried that there are some joints that could be tighter, and that the new floor squeaks in a couple of places. Less because I really mind those little issues per se, and more in case it betrays a deeper flaw. But I have no idea what I’m doing. This could be normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-interface.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flooring meets the wall&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Eventually there will be new skirting&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing all the flooring also means replacing the skirting board along the perimeter. This covers the expansion gap left around the flooring material to allow for expansion and contraction. The existing stuff was a pretty uninspiring stick-on vinyl. I haven’t gotten into what will replace it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-storage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Materials&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Materials ready to go&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still a ton to do. The fire protection firm hasn’t been especially responsive. Next week I’m hoping they’ll get the various cabinets installed, and they should be able to close and plaster some of the walls that aren’t affected by the fire sprinkler.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Millwork Begins</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The bad news: it may take ages to deal with the fire sprinkler. The good news: work continues on the other side of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire protection company made a visit on Wednesday. The sprinkler head definitely needs to be replaced: at the point it has any paint on it, it’s no longer useful. It will also be necessary to run a new sprinkler head in the new kitchen wall, so that the relocated cooking area is directly covered by a sprinkler. On the plus side, it should be possible to conceal the sprinkler in the wall, so I won’t have any weird pipe running across the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’d like to hope otherwise, the person from the fire protection company suggested it could take many weeks just to get the permit to change the fire sprinkler, let alone actually do the work. All of which does not bode well from a time or cost perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/boxes-angle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Another view of the cabinet boxes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The millwork on the other side of the wall has started going in, though, which is good to see. It’s weird. The cabinet boxes are both smaller and larger than I had imagined now they’re roughly in place. I’m slightly worried about the space between some of the cabinets and some circulation space. In other places, it’s not as bad as I feared it might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/flooring-start.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Another view of the cabinet boxes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve also started putting down the new flooring. It’s really pleasing to see it in place, both from the perspective of seeing progress and knowing that I’ve made a choice I like for the new material. So much of this project is a leap of faith; it’s nice when the concept is just as good when executed as it is on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more of that to go. And the rest of the cabinets should go in soon as well. Those have been fabricated to custom sizes so that the limited space is maximized.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Moving Ahead</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the project didn’t need to stop for the fire sprinkler. All that matters is having a sprinkler that meets requirements. Practically, that means some walls need to remain open in case the sprinkler does need to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some isn’t all, though, so they were able to make some progress today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, they’ve started closing the walls on the kitchen side of the new partition. If I’m reading the materials correctly, they’ve used blue board rather than normal drywall. It’s made of the same stuff, but has a special outside surface designed to take veneer plaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/board-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boarding on the kitchen side&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Closing on the kitchen side&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing this is meant to help match with the existing walls, which are all plaster from the 1950s before gypsum wallboard became the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire protection company is coming on Wednesday to give closure (or at least what comes next) on the fire sprinkler situation. That should let the crew close the rest of the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, this should allow for the installation of the cabinets now that the kitchen side is closed up.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>It's Always Something</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Just when I thought things would start moving again, there has been another snag. In particular, there’s an inspection issue with the fire sprinkler in the former kitchen space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sprinkler itself has always confused me. In most buildings there are either sprinklers in every room or no sprinklers at all. My apartment — and all the others in my building, as far as I’m aware — have one sprinkler, and it’s only in the original kitchen spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some level this makes sense. Cooking generates a lot of heat, and people often use oil to cook, which is another fire hazard. In a multi-family setting, I can see why it would make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it’s bizarre and frustrating. Most acutely, the lack of sprinklers everywhere means that I have to have a second means of egress from my apartment (beyond my front door), which is the reason I have a vestigial door in my bedroom that causes me no end of annoyances for no gain. Remedying that is a future renovation project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building inspection had two concerns with the sprinkler as the layout of my apartment has changed due to the renovation. First, that the coverage might not be as good or the same with the layout changes. Second, that the sprinkler might not work as designed because the previous owner did a shoddy paint job. The sprinkler isn’t supposed to be painted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delay is annoying on its face. It’s even more frustrating because it has to be done by the company who manages the fire suppression systems for the entire building rather than the contractor. I have to do all the coordination myself, and I’m not optimistic the fire suppression firm will be especially prompt. See also the earlier asbestos incident. Moreover, there was a communications gap: I didn’t hear about this requirement for several days, adding some needless delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this is fixed, it’s effectively impossible for the contractor to make further progress on the actual construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There too it’s hard to stay sanguine. I finally got a revised schedule for the rest of the program. It puts the completion date in mid-September. That’s &lt;em&gt;two months&lt;/em&gt; after the original completion date on a project that was only meant to take three months. And the schedule has already been blown: according to the chart they sent, drywall was supposed to happen on Monday. That can’t possibly happen given the delay with the sprinkler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Framing inspection (25-28 July)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insulation (28-29 July)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insulation inspection (29 July-1 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drywall (1-3 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Base cabinet installation (3-5 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flooring installation (5-9 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wall cabinet installation (9-11 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countertop templates (11-12 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Panel installation (12-17 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Baseboard (17-18 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Priming (18-19 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First coat (19-22 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second coat (22-23 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countertop installation (23-24 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cabinet handles (24-25 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Electric fixture installation (25-26 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plumbing fixture installation (26-29 August)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Punch list (29 August-5 September)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cleaning (5-6 September)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final electrical inspection (6-8 September)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final plumbing inspection (8-12 September)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final inspection (12-14 September)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll make do — there’s not much choice at this point — but suffice to say cracks are beginning to show in my level of patience.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Inspected</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s not too much to say for the last few weeks. But there was a bit of progress: earlier in the week the electrical inspector paid the site a visit, and passed the work. The project is still behind schedule, but this is encouraging progress to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a budget perspective, there were a few interesting twists. The plumbing work to move the sink and add laundry wound up being more expensive than the original scope of the project suggested. The plumber hadn’t anticipated needing to replace quite as much of the drain and vent stack from what I’m told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, through some accounting I don’t totally understand, the very expensive extra plumbing work got offset with savings elsewhere, so only wound up costing about $1,000 more net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, passing the rough inspections is a big step because it makes closing the walls (i.e., putting up the wallboard) possible. It goes without saying, that’s an important step in making progress.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Electric Progress</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;While I can’t quite tell if it’s done-done, there’s been encouraging progress on the electrical wiring. Most of the circuits are in place, and they’ve wired up my new panel to the original feeder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to see all the circuits run. We think of electricity as being an almost magical force, but in reality there really is a run of metal wire all the way from the outlet to a power station somewhere many miles away. There’s so much wiring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the walls are closed and the outlets and switches are installed, they can’t wire up all the new circuits to the new panel. But, since I’m still living on site, they did make sure that the circuits in the living spaces have power, which resulted in the rather hilarious situation I’m in now with a single 15 amp breaker in the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the work is more straightforward. There’s a tangle of circuits by the sink for the garbage disposal, dishwasher, and the transformers required for the LED strip lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circuits for the oven and cooktop are impressive to look at. Both appliances require more power — the cooktop I’ve selected can drive 7,700 W into a single pan! — which means they need an additional wire to get 240 V. They’re also much more substantial wires so they can safely run at 30 or 40 amps when they’re running at full power.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;More substantial wiring for power-hungry cooking appliances&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely sure what happens next. The inspection certificate on my front door suggests the electrical inspection hasn’t happened yet, and there are a couple of changes that need to happen on the electrical work so far. One outlet is in the wrong place. I’d also like to see if it’s possible to have a run of unconnected wiring left in the walls for a future bathroom renovation.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Plumbing Progress</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Progress continues working toward completion of the first fix plumbing and electric. The plumber was on site several days running the new drain, water, and vent lines for the relocated kitchen sink. From what I can tell, everything is ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of fun to see the parts of the old drain and vent stack that the plumber cut out to tie the new lines in. They’re very substantial chunks of pipe. Slightly more terrifying to peer into the old sections of pipe and see the accretion of sludge or corrosion or whatever builds up inside drain lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/plumbing-old-drain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sections of pipe&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Drain and vent lines removed to make way for new adapters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My building is about to spend $1.5 million replacing all the exterior balcony railings and floors. Perhaps the drain lines only need a good clean. I do slightly wonder how much it will cost and how complicated it will be if the drains actually need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My inner software developer brain wonders why the building doesn’t require anyone who opens the wall to replace that section of drain and vent completely, or even subsidize that. Compared to the complication of opening and then reassembling the wall of everyone’s apartments in the future, the expense and minor complication of replacing the whole section seems negligible. Perhaps another casualty of the American delusion we can all be completely self-sufficient. Or our procedure fetish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I’m still waiting for the electrical question to be resolved, keeping my fingers crossed that they’ll let me get away with not having to run a new feeder wire. From what I understand, getting the electrical work done is the next big step.&lt;/p&gt;
