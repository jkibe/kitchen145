                <title>An Electric Saga</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There was some excitement on site yesterday. I didn’t stay all day, but I managed to catch several people first thing in the morning. That provided me with a few updates, and I got to see the electrician’s crew in action as they began the first fix wiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the tangible progress is the most satisfying. They ran the rough wiring for a few of the smaller circuits, for appliances like the fridge-freezer and the dishwasher, and the various new outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/ff-checklist.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/ff-two-gang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/ff-wide.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/ff-old-switch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/ff-old-light.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They removed a lot of the vestigial outlets and wiring too, such as the old runs for the countertop outlets in the kitchen. Sadly, one of the few ceiling lights had to go. There was no way to save it without aesthetic compromises I wasn’t willing to live with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still no exact plan for the vexed question of the electrical panel’s feeder wire. The electrician was able to get the city to approve a three-wire configuration, using the conduit as the ground. But running a new feeder 100 feet through a 70-year-old conduit buried in a concrete slab is not sure thing. There’s thus some planning involved in the step: the electrician wants to have a “plan B” ready to go. Namely, destroying the common hallway to run a new feeder that way. I have to get the condo association to sign off on that before that’s on the table as the fallback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, I finally got everyone to understand the nuanced situation with the Miele heat pump dryer I’ve specified. This may save the day, depending on the electrician’s calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it uses a heat pump, this dryer consumes substantially less power than a traditional electric tumble dryer, and so requires only a 120 V 20 amp circuit rather than a 240 V 30 amp “dryer” circuit. It’s possible this gets the load down to below 60 amps, and no new feeder wire at all is required. Which would be great, for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as the electrical situation somewhat stabilizes, the plumbing has introduced a new wrinkle of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that he’s looked more carefully at the situation, the plumber has decided it’s not possible to use the kitchen’s drain line for the laundry stack. The exact logic isn’t entirely clear to me. The architects are consulting with an engineer to try and work around the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the outcome of that consultation, this wrinkle opens the possibility they have to run the plumbing through my bathroom stack. Which would mean opening more walls and tearing apart my bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once my finances have recovered from the kitchen project, I would eventually like to redo the bathroom. If they need to do a slightly ugly repair after tearing the wall open, maybe that’s fine, especially if it gets a sort of head start on the demolition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told they’ll have an opinion by later this week. Perhaps I’ll be looking at tile now after all.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Framing, Part III</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The crew made another trip and, as far as I can tell, they got the framing right on the third pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, they simply picked the framing up, moved it forward, and reattached it to the ground. That also required extending the platform where the cabinets will sit, and adjust the box for the soffit over the refrigerator and laundry cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is now in the same plane, and the new spaces have been properly delineated. While this apartment is never going to be enormous, I’m pleasantly surprised at the amount of space in the former kitchen area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the framing looks a little rough. It’s not clear to me whether that’s normal and reasonable, or something I should be worried about. I’m never going to see the framing once the project is done. Presumably framing with more finesse would be slower and more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also removed more of the wall of the former kitchen space, per what I think were the plumber’s instructions. It’s interesting to see the guts of the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/plumbing-wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;More wall is removed&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here too I’m slightly confused: the updating framing drawings suggested the whole wall would come down and be replaced with a new 2x4 wall. Avoiding work is good for me, the contractor, and the planet. I worry that not following the plan will cause other problems.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Framing, Part II</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week saw a bit of activity. It’s felt a bit like one step forward, two steps back. The framing is closer, but still not quite there. The plumbing work got going. And the electrical panel issue continues to vex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/framing-view.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View out the new aperture&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The new view out from the former kitchen area, correctly framed&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the framing front, the team came back for a second pass. They got closer; clearly the new set of drawings helped. Unfortunately, it’s still not quite right. The framing now has the aperture designed to let light into the former kitchen space, behind the new kitchen sink and dishwasher. It’s also been trimmed down to the right height, about a foot off the ceiling — it’s designed to line up with the height of structural concrete beams running through the space — that should let in even more light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XhTnkUX7Fgs&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they didn’t quite get it right. The whole wall needs to be in one plane, not offset. Talking to both the architects and the project manager on the job, it will get fixed. In all honesty, I do find it rather baffling. I noticed the issue myself, and I’m definitely not an expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/framing-alignment-close.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Out of plane&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The whole wall should be in the same plane&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the plumber stopped by to begin getting ready for the first fix. From what I can tell, he removed the old plumbing and added valves off the building’s main water lines in preparation for the next step. I’m guessing that can’t happen until the framing gets fixed, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/discarded-plumbing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Remnants of plumbing&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The old sink connections&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;images/plumbing-capped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Capped plumbing&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;New valves in the kitchen plumbing stack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electrical situation continues to cause a problem. Apparently the head electrician is on vacation in Brazil, and so isn’t around to negotiate with the electrical inspectors. It would really be nice if I didn’t need to run a new feeder through the common corridor, if they insist that I have a four-wire feeder that won’t fit in the conduit.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Shopping and Delivery</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;No building as such has happened in the last few days, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing happening. There’s been some coordination on the framing, I’m working on procuring the fixtures I’m responsible for, and the cabinets have arrived on site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the framing, my architects prepared some new and hopefully clearer drawings for the framers on their next visit. Without putting too fine a point on it, it’s pretty clear that the framing isn’t what it needed to be. Having chatted with everyone about the issue, I have some confidence that the framing will get resolved in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I’m working on the procurement of parts I have to buy: the appliances, plumbing fixtures, and electrical components like lighting. The sink and faucet arrived almost as soon as I ordered them, thankfully in the right colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/sink-box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sink in a box&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The sink and faucet have arrived&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is proving a bit trickier. The vent hood was supposed to ship this week, and still hasn’t. The remaining appliances that I’m ordering from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yaleappliance.com&quot;&gt;local Miele dealer&lt;/a&gt; are more concerning still in our pandemic supply chain era. The refrigerator-freezer is only a few weeks out, which is good. All the Miele appliances, though, from the oven to the tumble dryer, are at least a month out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re having me put down a 50% deposit to get them on order, and then I have to cross my fingers they’ll get here in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More excitingly, the cabinets have made it to site. The delivery process was not quite as smooth as it could’ve been. They didn’t give us any notice: it was a good thing I was up early on the day they arrived. More outside my control, the largest of the panels didn’t fit in the freight elevator. I’m having to temporarily store those in the common basement area. Apparently they need to go to someone’s shop for further processing in any case, so I’m hoping they won’t linger in the basement long enough for anyone to get upset with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/reform-panels-packaging.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Reform panels&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Some of the larger cabinet doors and panels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/reform-packaging.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinet doors in packaging&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A few panels in their protective packing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;images/reform-date.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Reform packing slip&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;They really did start working on this order over a year ago&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the electrical front, more drama still. From what I’ve been told, the electrical inspector has now decided that in addition to upgrading to minimum 100 amp service, I also need to run a feeder line with four conductors: the two hots, neutral, and ground. This poses a problem because the existing conduit, which runs through a cast concrete slab to the electrical meter in the trash room, is only sized for three conductors. Complying with that would require ripping apart the ceiling in the common hallway, which no one is going to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/old-panel-uncovered.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The existing panel&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The existing panel with its cover off: the feeder is the thick set of conductors coming into the box on the top right&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping they can get an exemption to this, or better still convince the inspector to let me keep the existing feeder wire in place. It’s been fine for over a dozen other people who’ve done recent renovations. Why they would suddenly require it now is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/plumbing-wall-wide.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wall with plumbing&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/plumbing-wall-detail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wall with plumbing, detail&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plumber stopped by last week as well. He wants the lower half of the wall against the plumbing stack removed to do the new work. And there’s consensus that the supports for that wall are unlikely to be sufficient for all the weight that it will support. (This makes me slightly concerned that I had several upper cabinets filled with dishes hanging off of it!) So: the wall is coming down in the second and hopefully final batch of demolition slated to happen in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Framing</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The renovation continues, and appears to have hit its first hiccup. The framing started today, which was exciting. Then I got home and began scratching my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the design phase, my architects specified a non-standard wall to back the run of cabinets. To let light into the former kitchen, it doesn’t go up to the ceiling and there’s an opening behind the sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/cabinet-final.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinet render&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The vision (credit: BOS | UA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus my confusion when I got home and noticed that the framing for the new wall goes up to the ceiling. That, it turns out, was probably a mistake. I have some faith that it will get fixed, but it has to be said that it’s a little annoying. I was so excited when I left the house today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/framing-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;What was the kitchen&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The former kitchen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, seeing the walls at least approximately in the right place is encouraging. The former kitchen entry area is definitely small, but it’s a surprisingly nice space, all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;images/framing-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking back&quot; /&gt;

                <title>Demolition</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The project has begun! More through coincidence than any real planning, I was able to have the first step — demolition — take place while I was out of town. It was pretty surreal to come home to a construction site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, it’s definitely going to be a struggle. There is dust everywhere. So much that I saturated the medium particle filter in my vacuum cleaner after 20 minutes of trying to clear up the dust all over the place. If I hadn’t had an air purifier running in my bedroom, it’s scary to think how much more dust there would have been for me to clean up. I’m resigned to having to replace the filter far sooner than six months from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/demolition-zipwall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawings&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Zipwalls help, but they're far from a panacea for keeping dust out of the non-work areas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/demolition-drawing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawings&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architect managing my project thought it would be a good idea to cover the windows in protective plastic, and then someone unplugged the power to my old iPhone anyway, so I don’t have any time-lapse footage of the demolition. I’m working on rigging something up in a location that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of fun to see some of the old finishes that previous inhabitants of the apartment have tried out. Having wallpaper in the kitchen (especially one so small) doesn’t seem like a great idea to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/demolition-wallpaper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old wallpaper&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/demolition-wallpaper-red.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;More old wallpaper&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Not a pattern I'd put in a kitchen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also fun to finally understand some of the construction details of the building. On some level, I understand that I basically live in a concrete box. Seeing it makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/demolition-beam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beam detail&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demolition has finally uncovered how the interior, non-load bearing walls of my apartment were constructed. They’re weirdly thin — around 3” rather than the typical 5” — and definitely not constructed with modern materials like wood framing and gypsum wall board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had assumed it was lath and plaster with ancient wiring, but was surprised to discover it’s something else entirely. From what I can see, it looks like they substituted a kind of metal mesh for the lath, and then did infill with what looks like thinset cement, which was then given a skim coat of plaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image-card width-wide caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;images/demolition-wall-detail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wall detail&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;An interesting lath and plaster alternative&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d always wondered how the electrical lines were run, again, given that the structure of my building is cast concrete. Maybe not surprisingly, everything was run through metal conduits. It makes me somewhat less optimistic that it would be easy to do something like run new wiring for an additional ceiling light. It goes without saying, cutting a channel into cast concrete is not a walk in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The End of the Beginning</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s really happening: the demolition for the new kitchen begins on Tuesday next week. And it’s been even more of a mad dash to make sure that happened, and that everything was in place for it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the last post, once the contractor got the permit, it was really a race to get everything in place. With no small amount of stress and scrambling, I managed to thread that needle. The movers showed up on time to pick up the larger pieces of furniture, and I spent evenings and the two weekends bringing box after box to my basement storage unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of work. I told myself that only packing up part of my apartment wouldn’t be as bad as a full-on move, and I’m not sure I was right. I used almost all the boxes I had saved from the last time I moved, and my basement storage unit is pretty full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an accretion effect: none of the tasks to get my apartment ready for construction was really that onerous, but put together, it was a lot. Going on a brutalist adventure to city hall to get a parking permit — necessary when you need to put the permit up the same day — only took about an hour. But then it also took an hour to pack and transport a few boxes down to the basement. It really adds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s done, and a crew will show up on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to drop letters off to all my neighbors. And, assuming I don’t get sucked into any meetings on Monday, I’ll pop in to the project kick off with the architects and contractor’s team.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Permit Dash</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;For once, some good news on the project: my contractor got the permit way ahead of schedule. On the other hand, I wasn’t really prepared for them to get it so quickly. It was supposed to take about a month from contract signature; it wound up taking about two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took about a week of back-and-forth with my building manager to get the sign off from my condo association for the project. At which point, the contractor applied for the permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were going over the contract, it was explained to me that it would take about 30 days to get the permit. Not because it had to, but because that’s the time limit the City of Boston operates under, and, in my team’s experience, they usually took the whole window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus my immense surprise when, two days later, I got a phone call from the contractor that the permit was approved, and they were ready to go. I got the impression they could’ve started the next morning had I been ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before they start, however, I’m going to have to move all my stuff out of the work area. Most of this will go elsewhere in my apartment or my building. I have basement storage in the basement, and I bought a $20 Ikea garment rack to hold my clothes in the (relative) safety of my bedroom. That’s been my weekend project, hauling one box of stuff down to the basement after another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stickier issue is getting the larger pieces of furniture out, like my dining table. That really won’t fit anywhere else, and so I needed to find a moving and storage company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking there’s a business opportunity buried in the madness of finding movers, in the same way I found the process of finding a contractor so fraught. If there’s anything even remotely non-standard about your move, no one reads the notes, and the estimate doesn’t seem to take the details into account. Plus there’s all the other complication of having to get a parking permit from the city and from my condo association to make sure the move is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve found movers, a nice technology-forward company called Small Haul, that focuses on small moving jobs, and who (blessedly) has a storage partner that isn’t at capacity. I didn’t have the presence of mind to clear the date with the people who manage my building, so it’s looking like it will be a mad dash on Monday morning to get the details ironed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really pushing to get the work going in two weeks, when I have a good excuse not to be at home while they’re getting going and doing the demolition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has also been an interesting test of the project management stance of the system. With so many people and so many parts in motion, I can see how communication is vital. The architect managing my project suggested we have a weekly check-in meeting, and I’m beginning to see the value in that, to make sure information flows well between the group.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Contract Signature</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is done! Today I got the contract and signed. I’ll also get the first payment in the mail to the contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wound up going for what I thought was a reasonably modern experience. The architect shepherding my project prepared the standard A105 (a standard contract for small projects), which was first executed by the contractor, and then given to me for signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, I need to mail the contractor a check for the first payment. At that point, they’ll get going on the permitting process, which formally gates the construction beginning in earnest. That’s supposed to take about 30 days, and then adding the three months of construction, the project should be substantially complete around the middle of July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the last post, this included a not-so-fun extra $1,000 or so for an additional chunk of wall to facilitate the necessary electrical upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final contract’s cost breakdown was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Cost&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Permitting&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$810&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;General conditions&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$7,428.24&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Preparation and demolition&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$3,645&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Carpentry (including flooring material)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$18,250&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Electrical&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$14,842.25&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Plumbing&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$7,672&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Patching and painting&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$4,290&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Countertops&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$11,853.70&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those costs, a few were broken out to account for potential variance. This is meant to make it fairer should one of the more speculative items cost more or less than anticipated. For instance, I really hope running a new feeder wire does not do $1,000 in damage to the common areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flooring: $4,800&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fire sprinkler changes: $900&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Painting and patching common areas: $1,000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countertop material: $5,692&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is then broken out into a payment schedule based on milestones, which someone from my architect’s office will assess and gate payment for as part of their construction administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payment 1: Contract signature: $9,015.72&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payment 2: Work begins: $17,462.89&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payment 3: First fix electrical and plumbing plus framing: $16,146.39&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payment 4: After millwork installation: $8,843.90&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payment 5: After flooring is installed plus second fix plumbing and electrical: $10,322.80&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payment 6: After final inspections and completion: $7,000.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my attention turns to finding somewhere to store all of my large furniture when the project is moving. The clock is ticking!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Bidding, Part IV</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The good news: I have the final contract, potentially ready to sign. As ever, though, it has been a lesson in the perils of doing a construction project. Or perhaps more specifically, a fairly high-specification construction project in a difficult site in a historic neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I’m ready to sign. My architects set me and the contractor up with an A105, which I’m informed is a pretty standard contract for smaller architect-led projects. Most importantly in my mind, it does a more precise job laying out how the architect interfaces with the owner and contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s taken about a week to hash out some final details. I’m less clear what’s gone on from the contractor’s side. From my end, there was some additional insurance I didn’t realize I didn’t have because of the strange way my condo association buys insurance for my whole building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contractor needs to execute the document first, and then I’ll execute, and we’re ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the saga of the electrical upgrade continues. The potential feeder wire replacement was not enough. Now it seems that they’ll have to build out a new wall (confusingly, in front of an existing wall) to contain the new electrical panel and feeder wiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adds another $1,000 or so to the project cost, which I’m not exactly thrilled about. On the other hand, I knew what I was getting into, and I’m not completely surprised this (and many other unexpected costs) have emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does make me appreciate how renovation projects wind up being diluted by the time they’re completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are places where it’s really not possible to scrimp. While annoying, it would be far worse to have a completed project that fails inspection than to cut elsewhere in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it’s very clear exactly where people would scrimp. Buying that $300 dishwasher instead of the $1000 dishwasher almost pays for the unexpected wall construction. Downgrading the flooring material to vinyl plank that goes for $4 per square foot instead of high-spec, $10 per square foot engineered hardwood would come close to covering the cost of running a new feeder wire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something very disappointing about the idea of putting in so much work, only to have it fall down on the details.&lt;/p&gt;
